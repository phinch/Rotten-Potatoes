February 28, 2016|Food & Service were excellent.|5|On a friend's recommendation, stopped here before going to a play at Trinity Rep, right around the corner. Opted to eat at the bar rather than the full dining room, which seemed a little cramped. The food was outstanding, although we only shared an appetizer and each had a salad. The white bean bruschetta appetizer was wonderful. We used the bread served separately to sop up the last bits of the white beans. My wife had the roasted brussel sprout salad and loved it. I had the Greek salad, which was different from the usual fare, with a big slab of feta cheese that I broke up to pair with bites of ripe tomato or cucumber. Great olive oil dressing. Tracy, the bartender, was a gem at service. Professional with a very sunny disposition. The right amount of attention. We will be back.

We had a reservation but had to wait for 45 minutes. To compensate we were given a bottle of Lambrusco after our meal. We had already had our wine quota so this was wasted and not everyone at the table drinks red wine. A better peace offering would have been dessert or wine on the house or a gift card."

February 26, 2016|FANTASTIC FOOD!|5|Cannot say enough great things about this restaurant! You can tell they put a lot of love into this menu!
February 21, 2016|Nice evening|5|We went with friends after seeing a play on a Sunday evening. We had a lovely dinner and our friend enjoyed her birthday.

January 31, 2016|A Gem|4|Visited Rosilina for the first time with a group of friends and we all agreed we had found a gem. The food was incredible. It reminded me of my trips to Italy. There were plenty of choices on the wine list and the Chianti we chose was the perfect compliment to our meal. The service was outstanding. Will was very attentive and had a great personality. We will definitely be back.

Enjoyed an exquisite Brussels sprouts, apple, pancetta salad and a very rich house made pasta with veal ragu and spring peas. Great service and reasonably priced.
January 30, 2016|A great find.|5|There were four people in our party, we were seated promptly and enjoyed a wonderful dinner. The service was efficient and friendly and the waiter was very pleasant. He answered all of our questions. Each of us had a different appetizer and meal, everyone was impressed with their food. The wine on tap was surprisingly very good. We all will return to Rosalina's for a special celebration or a night out. Thank you, Donna
January 29, 2016|1st time|3|I enjoyed the food at Rosalina s but the table near the door was freezing all night with people coming and going.l Our waitress was very nice and we did enjoy the atmosphere. Again much too cold for comfort. Maybe will be back in the spring or summertime.
January 29, 2016|Tight|4|The food was great. Service sometimes felt like because I was a party of two, fell through the cracks to the larger parties. Place is small, not much you can do with that but you'll get to know your neighbor well
January 28, 2016|outstanding|5|Great food, awesome service, valet service was outstanding
January 28, 2016|I love Rosalina!|5|We had a small group of high school friends meet at Rosalina. Most had never been. Everyone was impressed. The food was fantastic and we all loved the evening.
January 26, 2016|Couldn't handle the crowd|2|Rosalina's had a big crowd because of the PC basketball game. Unfortunately, they couldn't handle. Reception and seating were chaotic and confused. Hostess was awful. Waiter was good though. Food was mediocre and salty.
January 19, 2016|Great Dinner!|5|Had a wonderful dinner here with my significant other. It was restaurant week and we both took advantage of the special menu! The food was amazing the service was top notch. Will be going back again soon!
January 19, 2016|First Time|5|Came here for Restaurant week. Got the pork loin that was the size of my head and it was cooked perfectly. Would have liked to try some of the pasta dishes but I was not disappointed. This is 100% a place I want to come back to and soon.
January 16, 2016|The food was absolutely delicious.|5|Friends and I are planning on going out for a lady's night because we thought it was so delicious.

January 14, 2016|Special Dinner|5|Delicious dinner! excellent service! Special night!
January 13, 2016|Just One Complaint|3|It was a pleasurable evening, until the end,when our waitress threw out an unfinished bottle of wine. It had at least one good size glass remaining (much more than 6 ozs). We asked what had happened to it and she retrieved it from the trash! No apologies. Bad ending.

December 31, 2015|We will be back!|5|We were a group of 6 adults for New Year's Eve. The food was excellent- lots of options and the food was just wonderful. The menu had interesting combinations and sides, and the drinks were inspired. I tried the fried dough pizza (excellent) and gnocchi. My companions had deserts and raved about the chocolate polenta dish!
December 27, 2015|Family Christmas, Just the girls|5|We had an all girls family reunion here the Sunday after Christmas. It was fantastic! The was excellent, great gluten free options too! The waiter was just amazing!
December 26, 2015|Outstanding!!|5|A group of six of us decided to visit this restaurant after a review was posted in the Providence Journal. My wife and I had been there last year, but I vaguely remembered the place, but once inside I did recall the location. The service was great even though the last meal to be served came out a few minutes after the first five, which drives me crazy. The wait staff was attentive, the menu offered some unique dishes and everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The wine list was notable with a variety of wines offered globally. We found the pricing very reasonable, about $125 per couple with the tip and no one left hungry or thirsty. We did have apps before our main course but no dessert. The meal also included several bottles of Italian wine and some various cocktails. We all agreed that Rosalina's was a keeper and we will return!!
December 19, 2015|Delicious but very crowded and noisy|4|Delicious but very crowded and noisy
December 12, 2015|Rosalina is a Gem|5|Convenient to the theaters of Providence, Rosalina provides a very special Italian dining experience. From the excellent bread and dipping bowl to the great wine choices and the tasty antipasto followed by excellent entrees one cannot go wrong. Moderately priced with great service and a bistro atmosphere you are sure to enjoy the experience. We have been back several times and it never falls short of our expectations. I am a fussy first generation Italian American who likes to cook as well so I can be a harsh critic of Italian cuisine. Rosalina passes the test.

November 19, 2015|Bene!|4|Great food. Good service. Very noisy (energetic!) Vegan friendly Excellent bar. Perfect for before Trinity or PPAC.
November 15, 2015|Jackelyn's 25th Birthday|4|We enjoyed a lovely dinner for 3 before the Bill Maher show at PPAC Sunday night. Great atmosphere. Loved the food. We have the antipasto to start, ravioli and butternut squash risotto. Crème Brulee for dessert. The service was also an A+. Will def return!
November 8, 2015|Great food and in the end, a great serve...|4|Great food and in the end, a great server. Love the space and ambiance, but the tables are setup far too tightly together. We had a reservation for 430 and were asked to cram into a very tight table between 3 other full ones in an otherwise empty restaurant. Hostess was gracious in letting us change but another one of the servers basically threw a fit.
November 7, 2015|this was a great find.  I normally don't...|5|this was a great find. I normally don't like sitting close to people, but the food, the staff and the energy put all that aside. I can't think of anything negative. Even outside by the heaters. It's nice spot for the Theatre District
November 6, 2015|Nice Place|4|Lively dining room, with nice bar and open kitchen. Service was good, nice wine selection. Eggplant appetizer was great, would have been happy with a bowl of the marinara. Squid ink Pasta was good, Branzino was nicely done with olive oil and lemon, but the tapanade was a bit flavor forward for the delicate fish. Will surely come back soon.
November 1, 2015|Another Friend was Impressed|5|We have taken many friends to Rosalina for their first visit. We have never been disappointed. Our friends have always returned on their own to enjoy the food and vive of Rosalina's
October 31, 2015|Poor waitress service!|4|The waitress didn't ask if it was our first visit to Rosalina or made food/drinks recommendations. She was pressured and too informal. The rest was okay, but not too excited to go again.
October 27, 2015|Excellent except for one thing|4|Brussel sprout salad was to die for! Unfortunately my friend didn't like her entree (she brought home for her husband) so she was going to order something else. But the waiter never came back to check how everything was until is was too late to order something else...
October 22, 2015|Much too noisy|3|Much too noisy
October 20, 2015|Great service great food!|5|Loved this restaurant and have been there 3 times now when visiting RI. Great service, always attentive, loved the food each time.The steak, pasta and fish dishes are all outstanding.
Dined on October 20, 2015|4 girls for dinner|5|4 different pasta chosen. Portions were huge- could easily have shared a main and added a salad or appetizer. Prices fair. Service fine. Very enjoyable pre theater dinner.
October 17, 2015|Light on the Salt and Flavor|3|"This was resoundingly ""okay"". The service was okay; the ambiance was okay; the wine was okay. Their food was beautifully plated, abundant for the price, and generally inoffensive. But if you're going to make food people want to eat as opposed to take pictures of, it needs to be more than inoffensive and pretty it should taste great! All their food, the pasta dishes especially, really needed a good hit of salt or some acidity to punch up the flavor. In my opinion, the Bolognese was the worst offender by far. With noodles as good as they have, it's a disservice to bury them in bland meat sauce. A big pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon, or a dash of red wine vinegar all could have made this dish a thousand time more delicious. I won't be going again because I refuse to pay for food I could cook better and more flavorfully at home."
October 16, 2015|First Visit|4|This was our first visit to Rosalina's and definitely not our last the food was delicious!! Very reasonably priced, and staff was very personable. Thank you, it was our Anniversary dinner and it was excellent.
October 10, 2015|Wow, wow and wow|5|"A friend recommended Rosalina when she heard we were visiting Providence for the weekend. We heard good things but were blown away by the professional, yet welcoming waitstaff; the cool, hip ambiance; and the fantastic food. Never heard of polenta-based lasagna - which was so light and perfectly prepared. The ravioli and meatballs were incredible. And then the desserts - a banana-chocolate-polenta infused ""pudding"" that we literally were fighting over. We can't wait to go back!"
October 3, 2015|Wonderful family dinner|4|My family and I had an amazing dinner at Rosalina's. The tables are a bit close, and the acoustics are a bit loud, but the ambiance is still warm and inviting, and reminded me of some of the restaurants I had been to in Florence. They have a great olive oil, made by there own family in Europe, that they serve with their bread. The burrata salads were wonderful and the pasta dishes were delicious (we're still enjoying the leftover Bolognese). For dessert we had ordered the special, however due to a complication in the kitchen they could not make it and forgot to tell us. While normally forgetting something would result in a negative rating, the manager was very nice and came over, apologized profusely and gave us another dessert (tiramisu!!) and a bottle of champagne. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for their amazing food and wonderful service.
October 3, 2015|I had very high expectations for this restaurant.|3|It turned out to be less than what I hoped for. Don't get me wrong, the food was good and the ambiance was different than lots of what there is in Providence, but I just think that for the money, there are plenty of other places I would choose in Providence over Rosalina.
October 2, 2015|Vibrant and Tasty|4|Rosalina is a vibrant and dependable place to dine prior to going to theaters in the area. Having eaten at the restaurant several times, one can always count on the eggplant appetizer, a reasonable wine list, and caring service. The big booths by the window can take a large party and it feels very festive. It is quite noisy on the night we dined which may not be the best place for a one-on-one conversation.
September 18, 2015|Neighborhood Gem|3|Small but Quaint. Fresh Pasta, aged olive oil and awesome cheesecake! A great stop before a PC Game, PPAC or Trinity Event.
September 5, 2015|Delicious food with attentive service.|5|Delicious food with attentive service.

August 19, 2015|My friend had the pasta with vegetables ...|3|My friend had the pasta with vegetables and the pasta was over cooked. I selected the veal pram with spaghetti, a basic. The sauce(gravy here in RI) was too sweet. Sausage/ pepper app good, eggplant app,sauce too sweet.
August 9, 2015|Italian off the Hill|4|Looking for a new Italian restaurant away from Federal Hill since we had tried most of them and it gets old after awhile. This smallish place just down the street from Trinity on a slow Sunday evening was exactly what we were looking for. Great service, interesting food. Only disappointment was that I expect Italian restaurants to have at least one zuppa on the menu even if it is summer--there are many cold possibilities that this kitchen could certainly do well. I can imagine this being a great place for after work drinks as well and we will certainly book it again for some pre/post play evening.
August 7, 2015|very fresh tasting|4|We all thought the food was great, very fresh tasting. The burrata with grilled peaches was amazing.
July 24, 2015|Quiet, please!|4|Having been to Rosalina's for a late afternoon drink at the bar, we decided to check it out for dinner one night. We started with the fried pizza appetizer - good, not great. Dining partner had a great Caesar though. I had the eggplant appetizer for my dinner, he had the pasta bolognese. Both were great. Having said that, I must say that even early (6:30 on a Friday nite), the noise level was way too high, distractingly high! Not sure we'll be back for dinner, but late afternoon drinks at the bar - perhaps.
July 3, 2015|Excellent Italian near the convention center|5|Decided to give Rosalina a try based on online reviews. Our party of two adults and two kids was very happy with the choice. Grilled peach salad, fried dough appetizer, bolognese, and gnocchi were all excellent, although the fried dough probably wouldn't be popular with our Italian friends. Wine list was on the short side (and would have benefited from anything by Felsina, Fontodi, or Isole e Olena) but there were a few interesting choices available by the glass. The booth in the front of the restaurant was just perfect. If we find ourselves in Providence again, we'll be sure to book another table.
June 30, 2015|Old school italian dining|5|excellent food, great service, awesome homestyle dishes enhanced by several greek plates. Delicious!
June 27, 2015|Highs and Lows in a Lackluster Dining Experience|2|There were highs and lows when we went to Rosalina's. The highs were the waitress we had was great and provided great service except for one thing (I'll get to that later). The house blend white wine was good. The highlight of our meal was the eggplant parm appetizer. It was delicious. The red sauce was outstanding and the eggplant was cooked to perfection. I would go back here and sit at the bar and get the eggplant appetizer with a glass of wine. It was that good. The calamari appetizer we had was very underwhelming and extremely salty. I ordered the squid ink pasta with crab meat and chiles. The squid ink pasta was good and cooked al dente, but I could barely taste and crab in the dish and there was no spice from any chiles I could taste. I was disappointed in the dish as it seemed like it could be one to easily execute. My fiancée ordered the veal chop special that the waitress told us about. It was supposed to be a veal chop with spinach and potatoes and have a sauce over it. When the dish came out it did not come with the spinach but with asparagus, which was fine because my fiancée likes asparagus. The waitress apologized for it not coming with the spinach and told us she could have them make him some if he wanted, which he politely declined. Now this is where the waitress made a huge mistake. At this point when the dish came out and had the wrong vegetable with it, she could have also informed us that he did not get a veal chop, but a bone-in pork chop. That's right a pork chop instead of a veal chop. But the waitress did not. I think she didn't realize that the special probably had changed from the night before or something like that but just tried to play it off without letting us know. Well the pork chop was dry and the sauce they gave with it was lackluster and there was barely any of it. The highlight of that meal was the mashed potatoes. Not to mention when the bill came we got charged $32 for that special and it said veal on the bill. Disappointing.
June 20, 2015|Great Food|4|The food was great despite the fact there was a mistake with reservations. I booked through open table and then called to see if I could make my group size from 2 to 4 people which was no problem but then when I got there they moved my reservation to 4:00 instead. They accommodated us and we sat at bar.
June 18, 2015|Great!|5|Consistently good. Love the bolognese sauce and the Eggplant Parm! When available the Italian Wedding soup is one of the best I've had. The eggplant Parm is an appetizer...but it is enough for an entree if you have another appetizer or salad first.
June 13, 2015|I love this place and the food is pretty...|4|I love this place and the food is pretty good. The only critique is that the chefs need to hold off on the salt a bit. I've been here many times and every time I find the food rather salty. Otherwise, the service, atmosphere and food are top notch.
June 5, 2015|Great Experience|4|This place is consistently good. My husband got the whole sea bass with the twice baked potatoes and enjoyed it very much. I got the eggplant with Narragansett Creamery ricotta appetizer which is more than enough for a meal. Delicious! We'll definitely be back.
May 1, 2015|Dinner was not very good|2|I have been to Rosalina before and the food has been good. This last time, a bunch of us ordered several dishes and the quality had gone down. The 14oz steak was tough, leathery and not good tasting. The pasta dishes were all too salty and the ravioli one was cold Hope they improve. Great potential.
April 25, 2015|Good, not great...|3|Rosalina is a good restaurant to which we will return. Everything; food, drink, service, ambiance ranged from good to very good all around. Our party had the pappardelle bolognese, strip steak, and the Bronzini special. We also had the pizza frite appetizers. Food was plentiful, well prepared and presented. Service wasn't bad for a very busy Saturday night. Everything was good...just nothing exceptional. The steak was probably the weakest dish...little tougher than it should have been. The pappardelle had a little spicy kick to them...which I liked. The Bronzino elicited favorable reviews as well. Prior to going I noticed other reviewers raved about the pizza frite...it was ok...but did not remind me of the church bazaars of my youth where fried dough was served up. A solid eating experience...we plan to return. Only complaint...we were lucky to get a booth so our party was self contained with a sense of privacy. Most of the tables are pretty tightly packed...I personally do not care to be so close to other diners. And, I might add, the place is loud...I tend to like the energy of a bustling restaurant scene, but I understand why others may feel it was too busy and noisy...
April 22, 2015|VERY SMALL|3|WENT THERE WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE , FIRST OF ALL PLACE IS SO SMALL AND HAS A BAR RIGHT BEHIND TABLES, SAT NEAR KITCHEN, BETWEEN THE MUSIC, PEOPLE AT THE BAR TALKING WE COULD NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER, I HAD THE POLENTA WITH MEATBALLS POLENTA WAS VERY COULD AND SAUCE , BUT MEATBALLS WERE SO SALTY I COULD NOT EAT THEM , FRIEND HAD A MACARONI DISH DID NOT LIKE IT, TO MUCH HERBS ,OVERPOWERING, WOULD NOT GO BACK FOOD WAS OK
April 19, 2015|yum|5|happy find for us, food and staff amazing, all apps and main courses excellent, olive oil at table so bold, from greece, only sad thing was that we were too full for dessert! will definitely be returning, always fun to find a great new place to go. easy parking doesnt hurt.
April 11, 2015|Could'nt hear myself think!|2|Way Too Loud. Meatballs were a 10. Spring salad was a pile of cheese with asparagus. Swordfish had very very little taste. Gnocchi was actually rather good. Not a soft as preferred but good. Sauce was really good too. Simple with basil. Wine was good but overpriced. Service was pleasant but a bit slow. Tables were very close. Will try again by going back to eat at bar. 7 out of 10.
April 6, 2015|Great food and atmosphere! Terrific soup...|5|Great food and atmosphere! Terrific soup and pasta.
April 4, 2015|Excellent!!!!|5|Dinner was awesome! The service was pleasant and prompt. Cannot wait to return. Wish there was a bit more gnocchi with that entree.
March 24, 2015|Relaxing and Enjoyable with every bite|4|This has become a favorite spot prior to going to Trinity for an evening of theater. The service has been great for suggesting meals that allow one to make it to the theater on time. The menu is diverse and has something for everyone, although several of us dining continue to re-order the eggplant appetizer which is a meal in itself. The atmosphere is bright and relaxing and one can have a solid conversation without any problems.
March 19, 2015|pre-show venu|5|Rosalina is located literally around the corner from Trinity Rep. We were able to use our Trinity parking pass and walk less than a block to the restaurant. We told our waitperson our plans for the play, and she kept our order on track. The food was delicious!
March 14, 2015|Terrific dining and service!|5|It was our first time at this restaurant as we have been trying to make reservations, but were unable to do so, a day or two in advance. Now, we know why! Our meal was GREAT, and we are both foodies and Italian. The menu is unusal and worth trying; filled with both classic and more inventive Italian dishes. Our server was professional and friendly, knowledgeable and flexible. We will go back again, and again, and again! Near Trinity Rep Theater, in Providence, so it makes for a convenient dining/theater evening.
March 13, 2015|What a great find!|5|We decided to go to Rosalina based on previous reviews. It lived up to every word. There were 5 of us and we all loved it!
March 10, 2015|Great place!|5|It was the name that attracted me. And when I arrived Lauren, the owner, and Rosaline, her daughter treated me at the hostess stand. Lauren couldn't have been nicer and Rosalina is a little doll! As a Vegan, it's always challenging to find a restaurant that makes an effort to accommodate vegetarians and vegans. Here there is a delicious entree on the menu. A cauliflower steak over pasta with an awesome sauce. The salads were delicious. My companion had the eggplant park and said it was one of the best. So, as first impressions are often correct, I can't wait to get back and try something else. Lauren said she had no problem altering entrees to fit dietary needs.
March 7, 2015|A new pre-theater favorite. Laid back at...|4|A new pre-theater favorite. Laid back atmosphere but excellent fresh food. The Bolognese is wonderful without being overwhelming. Yellow layer cake for dessert was home baked and delicious.

The fried dough appetizer was delicious and the eggplant parm app was large enough for me to have as my meal. Friends had steak and swordfish and both loved them. The homemade yellow cake with dark chocolate butter cream was outstanding. Can't wait to go back!!
March 4, 2015|Nice choice for a pre theater meal.|4|Service was exceptional and the food served hot. Very pleasant experience!
March 1, 2015|Great new providence italian restaurant|5|Food was excellent; server was knowledgeable, small but great atmosphere.. Highly recommend
February 26, 2015|Rosalina is all about the food-it's amazing.|4|The food at Rosalina is second to none. It's fantastic. The service, however, leaves much to be desired. I've been there several times now and the servers don't know the menu well, cannot make recommendations, and are SLOW. Initial stop at the table, drinks, apps, meals-they all take way too long. Understand that the server can't help the speed of the kitchen, but it's not just the food that is slow to get there. I definitely recommend Rosalina, but plan to be there for a couple hours at least.
February 20, 2015|Excellent|5|One of our favorite restaurants in Providence. We highly recommend the pizza fritte as an appetizer. The pasta has yet to disappoint (fusilli, spaghetti, and gnocchi) and their meatballs are fantastic. Great place to celebrate the end of the day and enjoy a wonderful meal. Service has always been friendly and incredibly helpful.
February 20, 2015|Great for Friday Night with Friends|5|If you like good, well seasoned Italian food - and you plan ahead so you can get a reservation on the day and time you want, this is a fabulous place to try - the food was amazing, the staff was friendly and the ambience was comfortable. We will definitely go back!
Dined on January 30, 2015|Close to Trinity|4|Quite noisy, younger crowd. Go early to avoid that. Nice, helpful staff, food is good, sometimes very good. Creative ideas with ingredient combinations. Nice, broad wide list, something for everyone.. Adequate amounts in main courses but nothing else on plate, so sides raise the prices above average. Spotty service, but helpful staff generally.
January 28, 2015|Good The Second Time Around|4|We were seated promptly when we arrived and our server was very attentive to our needs. We shared a calamari which was as good as any one we have had. We each had a pasta dish which were filling & delicious. No dessert. A very comfortable enjoyable dinner.
January 23, 2015| Mediocre food, excellent service.|3|Crowded, hot spot for thirty something's. Great service, interesting menu....but the descriptions were far better than the food. I wouldn't bother going there for dinner again. Maybe a drink.
January 22, 2015|Great place for lunch|4|Although my first time there was lunch time, and there weren't many people, I did enjoy the ambiance and the service was excellent. I really enjoyed my meal and I must say the Tiramisu was even better than mine!! Great job!
January 20, 2015|Authentic Italian with a Greek flair|5|Food and service was simply excellent. Just about all their food is locally sourced. Best eggplant i've had in years. Salad was delicious made with Greek olive oil and feta. Dessert was an unbelievable cheese cake: a meal unto itself ... and it comes from a well known deli in NYC ... shhhh! :)
January 13, 2015|Food was very good & the portions sizable.|5|They have taken the chance with restaurant week and did a good job. The food was a good as I have had in resent memory. Like a old time Italian restaurant you would find in a Little Italy section in New York or other cities. Will go back again.
January 13, 2015|Amazing!|5|Rosalina is amazing! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was great. Everyone was so friendly and patient while I was trying to choose what to eat because everything sounded so good. The fresh bread with the Narragansett Creamery ricotta was outstanding. The eggplant parm, the burrata ravioli, and the cheesecake were also superb. I would go back here again and bring all of my friends! My new favorite restaurant!
January 2, 2015|Awesome as usual|5|Once again Rosalina was an absolute delight!!! We had a reservation and it was busier than normal, so we had to wait. Because of that, the owner gave us a glass of champagne and a glass of wine!!!! Both delicious!!! The food once again was amazing!!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!
January 2, 2015|Fantastic|5|We go to Rosalina at least once a month. The food is great, the atmosphere is awesome and the owner is extremely nice. I've been recommending this place to anyone who asks me for a good restaurant downtown.
December 31, 2014|Nye dinner|4|Went here with another couple for nye dinner. Place is cute, nice decor, apps were great, the men loved their meals but us girls both got bolognese and although people have raved about this dish we both found it to be just ok- a little heavy on the taste of Italian sausage. Would def go back and try something else though! Dessert was also great. Our server was good, nothing over the top. Overall nice place and will go back.
December 31, 2014| Nelli|4|Food is great but the seating in a long row of people does not allow for any privacy of conversation or ease in getting up without bumping the next diners.
December 28, 2014|lovely evening, great place|5|Went on a quiet Sunday night so hard to rate the vib, but the staff was terrific and the food was outstanding. Limited choices for managing my milk allergy, but the suggested dish, the gnoggi was awesome, just a bit heavier than my first choice, which had milk in the prep so couldn't be altered for dairy free.
December 14, 2014|An Italian Bistro|4|Rosalina is a great little Italian restaurant within walking distance of the Trinity Rep and PPAC. It is tiny so make a reservation. We really enjoyed our meal. Read the menu carefully because some plates take longer than others and if you have theatre tickets, like we did, it might interfere with you making it to the theatre on time. I picked something that would take longer, it was not mentioned on the menu that it would take longer so I had to pick something else. It was not a problem and my second choice was great. Out waitress was wonderful.
December 14, 2014|Never disappoints|5|Food is always excellent with really good service. This time they changed the menu and it was great.
December 12, 2014|Delicious Open Table Find!|4|My wife, daughter and I were heading to PPAC to see Camelot and wanted something close to the theater. This popped up on Open Table. I've never heard of it but the menu was interesting and the reviews were top notch. As we walked over from Westminster I was little leery with The Satin Doll staring me in the face and my 15 yr old daughter on our side. Once inside it didn't matter. The service was friendly but not overbearing. The food was amazing. I'm Italian, I've had dough boys a thousand times but the appetizer with the fried dough and their homemade sauce and cheese - well it would have made my mother cry! The focaccia and bread to start with local olive oil and ricotta was wonderful - it came out warm and so good. All three entrees were great. Gnocchi, Pasta con Pepe in a Parmesan bowl and a Cauliflower Steak of all things! We had a side of Brussels Sprouts and another preparation of Cauliflower as well (a big night in our family for Cauliflower I guess!) to round out the meal. There was no room for dessert although they sounded yummy. How good was it? Even before we left we were asking if they were open New Year's Day for the family celebration! Yum!
December 11, 2014|Best kept secret in Providence|5|Had a taste of Rosalina's at our residence and sought it out for the whole meal. It was excellent and price was reasonable. We will go back.
December 11, 2014|So-So|3|I had heard good things about Rosalina, but I was not too impressed. The décor leaves much to be desired; it is a small place with plaid picnic table napkins and gray tables. We started with the calamari, which is chilled but still good. The wines by the glass are reasonably priced. The service was a bit slow, considering the small space and not many patrons. The pork chop was tough, the rigatoni bianco was bland, but the roasted chicken was very good, and the cheesecake was rich and delicious. The place has its perks, but there are many better restaurants in Providence and RI
November 30, 2014|Rosalina is OK|3|Rosalina has a great vibe right when you walk in. The wait staff is bustling, the food smells good and you can see right into the kitchen, which is also hustling. The service here was magnificent. Waitstaff covered each other all the time; one guy spent all his time making sure each food order got out as soon as it was plated. Nice organization. We got bread and Greek olive oil made by a cousin of the owners. Very tasty bread and oil. I got a cocktail - ruby red vodka; aperol and another liquor (forgot the name) that made it taste a bit bubble-gummy. Not bad once I got over the bazooka flavor. Before I review the food, you should know we JUST got back from our first trip to Italy, so our taste-buds were completely spoiled. That said: My hubby and I ordered the Greek salad to start. We were kind of surprised there was no lettuce. That said, it was still a nice salad, though nothing special (winter tomatoes and cukes; feta; peppercini; and calamata olives). Had that good oil on it, though. Dinner for the hubby was calamari and ink pasta; I had the parpadelle bolognese. The inky pasta was only OK - not a lot of squid flavor and a fairly small amount of pasta. I, on the other hand, got the winning dish - a beautiful bolognese with veal, beef and pork; pasta cooked al dente; and fresh parmesean. I had to share - there was so much, and I wanted the husband to have some, too. All in all, I'd say the service was excellent, the food good, the oil great and the price just a bit more than we might have liked for the quality of the food. We may go back - just not get the calamari and ink pasta.
November 30, 2014|A mixed experience|3|I wish that I could say that our first visit to Rosalina was wonderful and that we can't wait to return but frankly it was only so-so and I'm not sure there are any other dishes on the menu that I would like to try. Appetizers were good--soup of the day and a caprese salad. I wish I could say the same for my main course. The bolognese went back to the kitchen. It was more like a fra diavolo with meat--way too fiery for my taste. Sadly, I didn't do any better on choosing a replacement dish. Hubby on the other hand thought the gnocchi some of the best he had ever tasted and he walked out a happy camper. If we ever return, I will make sure that we are not seated on the banquettes in the front window. A half round table for four people is really an awkward way to seat people; it was just so hard to carry on a conversation. A square makes for a much more intimate and friendly conversational space.
November 28, 2014|Good Italian Restaurant  Excellent service|5|We split the iceberg wedge and we had enough for two people. One had the veal chop and the other the pork chop--both were excellent Ariel was our server and did a good job. She helped me substitute polenta for mashed potatoes with my pork chop. The portions were very big. Both took half home and made another meal out of the leftovers. Once they get the front door thing fixed and everybody does not get a blast of freezing air each time somebody enters and leaves, it will be much better.
November 15, 2014|A don't miss in Prividence|5|Rosalina was a very pleasant surprise. Every dish was distinctive and beautifully done. Warm bread, always a distinctive mark of good service. They source their own olive oil, and it is worth every ounce of effort they expend. Lovely pastas. We definitely will return.
November 15, 2014|A truly special restaurant|4|"Rosalina's has a vibrant atmosphere and the food was very good. The presentation and choices were wonderful and something for every taste. The friends we were wtih enjoyed the ""scallop scampi, eggplant parm, steak (although it was a bit over cooked :( as well as creamed kale and a wedge salad. It was a cold night and every time the door opened the wind would rush in a brisk chill. They do offer free valet parking which is a plus in Providence. I would recommend Rosalina's ..."
November 8, 2014|VERY NICE  WOULD GO AGAIN  VERY GOOD FOO...|5|VERY NICE WOULD GO AGAIN VERY GOOD FOOD NICE WINE SELECTION
November 6, 2014|Good Italian/good prices|4|"Our server was a bit of a close talker, he acted ""too familiar"" with us. All of the food we ordered was good, the wine was reasonably priced. I guess I was a little disappointed because nothing was out if this world and I heard such rave reviews from friends (the server highly recommended brussel sprouts , they were over cooked and nothing special) the bolognase was very good, but not the best."
November 5, 2014|Great find.|5|We have eaten here for dinner several times. The food has been terrific and the service was great each time. Try the eggplant appetizer, Bolognese, and pasta with clams - they were all delicious. We will be back soon.
November 5, 2014|Fantastic!!|5|The food is outstanding and the service is even better. It is cool and hip and yet great for all ages. So wonderful that a really really great new Italian restaurant has opened in downtown. Also, I love when the owners and staff truly appreciate you dining with them and make you feel welcome. The other night I was attending PPAC at 7:00. The valet held our car and the staff offered to hold our leftovers in the refrigerator until after the play. What more can you ask for???
October 31, 2014|Delish|5|My family celebrated my birthday on October 31st! The food was incredible. My husband fell in love with the pomodoro sauce and my son was Impressed with the eggplant and polenta. Each appetizer had a beautiful presentation but most importantly, every bite was delicious! Our waitress was attentive but not intrusive and knew the menu well. I highly recommend Rosalina's if you are fussy about your Italian food! They nailed it!
October 31, 2014|Drove in from Newport and it was absolut...|5|Drove in from Newport and it was absolutely worth the drive. The owners came by to personally speak with us as did the chef who offered to make modifications to my pasta dish. Four of us dined and we all shared food, it was amazing. Will definitely go back! Valet parking is also a big plus!
October 26, 2014|Delish|5|Rosalina is a great place in the heart of the city. The food is fantastic and the service is wonderful. I have been telling all my friends to go here!
October 22, 2014|Group celebration|5|Hidden away off the beaten path, but well worth it. Limited menu, but everything our party of 6 ordered was fantastic. Having valet parking was a nice surprise and our waiter was attentive, but not hovering. Will definitely return!!!
October 15, 2014|Excellent food and service|4|Found Rosalina on OpenTable and decided to give it a try for our team dinner. The food was fantastic, very fresh and delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. Would definitely go back.
October 12, 2014|Service great, food very good, but noise...|4|Service great, food very good, but noisey for an early Sunday evening meal and the place was not full. I will go again.
October 12, 2014|terrible experience|1|its our anniversary, lets go to rosalina...worst decision ever! they sat us in a tiny two top with hardly anyspace, my husband is 6foot, 230lbs..cmon...the service was not great, but the food was the worst part! he got a steak, it was ALL FAT...it was the worst piece of steak ever...mash potatoes were ok, but burnt...my ravioli and meatballs were covered in oil...all around worst meal. we werent offered more drinks, dessert, etc...i had been before and it was okay, but this around around made me never want to go back.
October 11, 2014|Great food|4|Food was great and all our meals were hot which is great. Portions were right.
October 11, 2014|Beautiful!|5|The inside was adorable... Very old school Italian feel with some minor modern additions. The food was fabulous, and the drinks were really strong :) not to mention, the final bill was very reasonable! I recommend this to anyone looking for dinner on a budget!
October 10, 2014|GREAT|5|GOOD FOOD!! GREAT STAFF!!! NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY
October 8, 2014|Uninspired|2|A very limited menu, but after sampling a number of the dishes I can say it's just as well. The bar was busy, so maybe it's to the liking of some. But don't expect much from the kitchen. Service was amiable and competent.
October 4, 2014|Great new restaurant for us|5|Fried dough with sauce is excellent. Just like my mother's. Gnocci were well prepared like grandma's. Lamb shank was also well prepared but probably could have been cooked longer with more basting to better break down the meat. Great restaurant, appreciate the free valet parking. Our table was ready and reserved when we walked in. As were others. This is a nice small restaurant. Service was super. Ask for Sydney and you won't be disappointed.
October 3, 2014|First Timer|5|Enjoyed this urban Italian restaurant with complimentary valet parking. I was 1/2 hour early and with one extra person. The hostess made everything right without complaint. I had forgotten my glasses. The hostess found a pair of glasses for me to try. Turns out they were the restaurant owners glasses! Eggplant appetizer was amazing!!! My dinner arrived at room temperature. I reported this to the waitress when she checked on us. I did not want to take the time to have it rewarmed. She reported this to the owner who immediately apologized for the situation and assured me it would not take long. It didn't and I was grateful for the efforts as the increase in temperature complimented the dish! Great experience with caring people!
September 27, 2014|Nice place...|3|The food was very good, the service could have been better, but seeing a dancer from the Satin Doll Gentleman's club (located across the alley) in there with a customer just sent this dinner review spiraling in the wrong direction. I guess a better location would certainly help this place and the owners knowing that families want to eat there also.
Dined on September 27, 2014|Excellent!|5|Food, service and atmosphere was outstanding! The Paintings by local artist of significant people that inspired the creation of Rosalina are fabulous!
September 27, 2014|The food is the thing|3|I'll get this out of the way from the start: the food was very good, very much to out liking. I have no hesitation recommending this Italian restaurant based on their food. The tomato sauces varied, some were deeply roasted others sweet...good depth of flavor. Pastas were home-made, my dish of rigatoni with veal and cream was a big hit. Glasses of wine can be purchased in 2 serving sizes, a nice touch when pairing courses. OK, here are the misses: The place was freezing! We asked about it and were told that because the kitchen is open the place gets hot...so they crank the air..the server said it was always a problem. the tables are small weren't adjusted and kept tilting. Many apps are shareable but the server never advised us of that.
September 26, 2014|Home made pasta|3|Pasta dishes taste home made....not institutional nor out of a box.
September 20, 2014|Foteini|3|Appetizers were great. Not very impressed by entrees though..
September 20, 2014|Still working things out.|4|I was there on a Saturday night. Service was just fair. The table next ro us got there bread first. We had to ask for it. The menu is somewhat limited and there were no specials. The eggplant appetizer was delicious but parts of it were cold. My entree was ravioli which was also cold. I had to ask for it to be heated nut when it came back it was still not hot. It was very good though. Overall we liked the food.
September 13, 2014|Fun night out|5|Good energy level - good vegetarian options - nice bar choices- nice ambiance. Cauliflower dishes yummy!
September 13, 2014|Perfetto!|5|Authentic, original Italian food. Knowledgeable service and friendly owner. Will return again and again!
August 29, 2014|My favorite restaurant now!|5|The food was outstanding,especially the appetizers! We shared the appetizers and ordered 3 meals to share among 6 girls. We all thought it was fabulous. The server was outstanding and so helpful and friendly. We were not rushed at all. The owner came to our table and gave us complimentary glasses ofhomemade limoncello. Definitely going back very soon. Valet parking also, and he was so friendly, also.
August 23, 2014|Second time was the charm|5|We had tried this restaurant during their soft opening period and were delighted with one dish, but had to send another one back. Still the service was excellent and based on the gnocchi, we decided to try it again. My husband enjoyed The daily special of steamed clams with garlic toast. I had the eggplant Parmesan appetizer and a salad, both were generous portions. We loved it and will be returning soon. Do not expect to have a quiet conversation as this place is quite lovely. Valet parking was a nice plus too.
August 21, 2014|First time|4|Food was delicious from the bread through the dinners. The pasta wss cooked perfectly. The bolognese was fabulous. We'll definitely be back!
August 20, 2014|Great food - odd service|4|Came here with my wife for our anniversary, hoping that Rosalina would sort out our need for reasonably-priced, non-Goombah Italian food in Providence. The kitchen held up its end -- our burrata first course was lovely and our pasta courses (my pappardelle bolognese; her spaghetti with sauteed squash) were terrific. Bar and host staff were helpful, cheerful, and efficient; service for dinner was friendly but somewhere between distracted and disinterested. Slight fails included leaving the hot sauce for our oysters on the table through dessert (although points for bringing it unasked with the apps) and a bizarre lack of effort in my wife's simple request to have a scoop of both the hazelnut gelato (which was lovely) and the vanilla.
August 19, 2014|Nice Addition to the Scene|4|I found Rosalina to be a really nice addition to the downcity dining scene. Its location is a little off the main streets, so people are going to have to learn about it, but they will not be disappointed. The menu is a fun variety of takes on traditional Italian dishes with some Mediterranean variations and local ingredients thrown in. The portion sizes are moderate (unusual for Providence's robust Italian restaurants) but very well prepared and tasty. I especially liked the chilled calamari appetizer. Note that the preparations are a little different that the run-of-the-mill restaurants, so don't be caught off guard.
August 9, 2014|This was my second time at the restauran...|3|This was my second time at the restaurant and the traditional Italian fare was amazing. We started off with the stuffed shells and the eggplant, both amazing. I will also praise the restaurants sauces as well as their olive oil! I ordered the steak, which was ok, the spinach and potatos were phenomenal but the actual cut of meat was a little fatty. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop, which was very undercooked when we first received it. They cooked him a new one which was still slightly underdone. They apologized greatly, gave us a free salad as well as took the pork off the bill. I will still go back, many times I presume, they were very accommodating and felt extremely bad about the situation.
August 7, 2014|returning  just fothe olive oil!|4|I thoroughly enjoyed my greek salad (no lettuce :-) lunch at Rosalinas, but was overwhelmed by the amazing olive oil served to us with the bread. Her menu for lunch was really reasonably priced and everything was better than i have had anywhere in a very long time! :-)
July 26, 2014|Delicious food, mixed service|4|At first, the service was amazing. Appetizers were brought out quickly. I recommend getting the eggplant parm. as an appetizer. The owner's mother came over to our table to introduce herself and see how we were doing. She was very personable, knowledgeable and proud of the food being served, and really made us feel important. Then, the restaurant got busy and it was as if we were instantly neglected. We found bread crumbs floating in our waters and our en-trees took a good hour to come out. They were wonderful when we got them though. We weren't in any hurry but it was enough time for us to wonder if they forgot about us. Server was apologetic but then took forever to bring our check, even after asking two employees for it.
July 25, 2014|Great tasting food and location|4|Great high quality food, very reasonable prices, and professional staff. Highly recommended.
July 19, 2014|Added surprise of bellydancing!|5|My friends and I went here over the weekend of 7/20/14 and had a great time! The drinks were tasty, the food was really delicious, and best of all, the owners had a bellydancer for the other owner's birthday! Dinner and a show, I love places that don't take themselves too seriously. It took a little longer than desired to get our drinks, but otherwise everything was really incredible.
July 15, 2014|Newbie doesn't disappoint!|4|This newbie on the Providence food scene is great! Delicious menu - old family recipes - and huge portions. Staff was friendly and happy to slow our meal down so we could enjoy the night. Would go back!
July 12, 2014|Rosalina is the new place to try|5|If you're looking for a place with great food, good service and a fantastic ambience, look no further. It also has a great number of vegetarian options for the non-meat lovers.
July 12, 2014|Average|3|The food combinations listed on the menu were inventive and sounded delicious, but the appetizers and the meal were just average. Prices are very reasonable and the food is good, but just wasn't overly impressive. I kept thinking that everything I ordered was missing something. The restaurant was very clean and the staff extremely friendly. The owner went to every single table and greeted the customers and made sure they got everything they needed. I would probably go back again based solely on the service and ambience, but it wouldn't be my first pick for a spot for a special occasion.
July 12, 2014|Outstanding!|5|What a beautiful restaurant ! It has the feal of a chic NY city place. Cocktail list was fantastic. I had the satin doll with elderberry liquor and prosecco ( delicious ). For apps my husband and I shared the eggplant app and buratta cheese with citrus fruit. The apps were well presented and fabulous. For the main course we had the bolognese and swordfish . Best bolognese sauce I've ever had and my husband loved his swordfish. Dessert was Cheesecake that the owners pick up from NY themselves!! Now that's passion. The food was awesome and I can tell they use nothing but the best quality ingredients. Service was great and the owner even stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed our food. We will definitely be back!
July 2, 2014|Food on hand was very good, but some men...|4|Food on hand was very good, but some menu items were not available.
June 28, 2014|Kitchen needs help|3|We were seated and greeted on time which is always a plus. Our waiter was good, drinks and food orders taken in a timely manner. Kind of downhill after that as the kitchen was very slow. Waited over 30 minutes for apps. They were quite good but the wait was too long and the main dishes were served as we were finishing the apps which is a pet peeve of mine. The food was good not great but the waiting game made for a less than pleasant experience. And it was not just us, it seemed like nothing came out of the kitchen for any table for quite a longtime.
