ays ago|A fun spit as always|5|Good was delicious as always but two plates of four were not very warm and had to go back. Serve was nice but a bit over extended. Still one of our favs!
ays ago|1st Time - great experience!|4|This was our first time at at Providence Oyster Bar, needless to say the oysters ordered as an appetizer were outstanding!! I had a sushi platter as an entree that was fresh & delicious. Everyone in our group enjoyed their meals - will definitely go back!!
ays ago|Providence Oyster Bar Supreme|5|Late afternoon we decided to check out the bar and the raw bar before returning for dinner. We were glad we did. The prices were great for the raw bar; all kinds of oysters, delectable shrimp and supreme sushi. Glad we stopped in for the happy hour. Later that evening we returned for dinner and were treated like celebrities’; yes, they remembered our earlier visit. What a nice touch, what a nice way to welcome customers. I had the evening special, which was local cod that was prepared with a light sauce made in the pan by the chef. My sidekick had a handpicked lobster, which was prepared to perfection. Besides the great food it is a truly enjoyable overall experience. And yes, the wine list is extensive so that you can choose a wine that pairs beautifully with any entree chosen. Great experience; definitely recommend going! We will definitely return.
February 20, 2016|Excellent food and wine, service was average|4|Great food. A bit pricey. Not much ambiance. Valley parking is plus.
February 12, 2016|Good oysters & atmosphere|3|Great oysters and atmosphere, the rest of the menu was sub-par. Didn't finish our apps because they were pretty gross. Wine selection was vast, but over-priced and not descriptive. Staff was ok, got the job done but were not outstanding.
January 31, 2016|Excellent experience|5|Overall outstanding experience. very good variety in choices on menu, especially starters. Would have liked to have tried several dishes; but that will have to wait till next time.

January 16, 2016|Restaurant week|4|I had a good experience at the Providence Oyster Bar. Everyone was very nice from the valet to the waitstaff. We started off with a variety of Oysters and calamari. The oysters were amazing, the calamari was ok. Then we moved on to the entrees. The first dish was grilled swordfish over lobster mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Phenomenal combination! The swordfish had pesto sauce over it that added some great flavor. The lobster mashed potatoes had chunks of lobster in it! The second dish was shrimp scampi over linguine. Unfortunately this dish was bland and we did not enjoy it at all. My wife doesn't like sending food back so we moved the shrimp over to my plate and shared my entree. The dessert was tiramisu. It was good but I wouldn't order it again. I will definitely go back for the oysters and the swordfish plate.

January 9, 2016|First time guest..|4|It is unfortunate that servers have the ability to make what could have been a 5-star all around experience, nothing more than mediocre. After being seated it took 10 solid minutes to get greeted by our server - not the worst thing but highly annoying. Overall she was below average and seemingly uninspired being at work. The food (most important part) was stellar.. Chilean sea bass special was ridiculously perfect - the coconut curry was so flavorful and the sea bass was cooked to perfection with crisp exterior and moist interior. Baked stuffed shrimp were moist but the stuffing was mostly mushy seasoned bread with little to no seafood in it. Raw PEI oysters were crisp and clean and the rockerfeller were delicious. First time here since we live in Boston and won't be our last.
December 26, 2015|Amazing!|5|Incredible! I need not say more. Our waitress Kelley was amazing even though it was super busy. We felt like her only one. (8 mos. pregnant) She was wonderful.
December 5, 2015|Wonderful Food in a Quaint Setting|5|We were with a group of 6 and all thought the food and service were great. The oysters were plentiful and I personally recommend the Lobster Saute. When leaving, we needed a cab and there were none around so one of the valets - Tony - offered to drive us to our downtown hotel. A very nice and unexpected favor.

November 21, 2015|Energetic|4|We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Providence Oyster Bar. We ordered a bottle of wine on their menu, which they found that they hadn't chilled. They immediately went out and got a chilled one to make sure we had the wine we ordered. Our waitress was adorable and very attentive. The food was delicious. The restaurant was very busy, which made the noise level very loud. But, we would definitely go back there again when in the Providence area.
November 13, 2015|Great time|5|My visit was fantastic. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary and we could not have had a better time. The waitstaff prepared roses and allowed me to bring in my wife's favorite dessert. I would certainly recommend your establishment to others. Side note: I can't believe the chicken tenders are no longer on the menu. If possible, please bring back.
November 10, 2015|Mediocre at best...|3|Billed as a seafood restaurant, however they don't know how to cut and cook swordfish and offer nothing beyond standard seafood recipes. The swordfish was cut into a 2-3 inch wedge, which necessitated baking it after it was seared, resulting in dryness. No fish is served on the bone, meaning no whole trout, snapper, or bronzini available. Chowder not home made. Salads pedestrian. I wanted to like it, for there are so few seafood restaurants around, but it needs to improve its offerings and cooking techniques.
October 26, 2015|Very Disappointing|2|We were told this was one of the best seafood restaurants in Providence. Trendy place on federal hill. Our server seemed less than interested in being at work on the evening of our dinner. We ordered an appetizer that never showed up. Our entrees were served and when asked about the appetizer the server indicated they had forgotten to put the order in. I ordered fried oysters which were good (not great) but the French fries that came with them were soggy and greasy.

September 13, 2015|The seafood was outstanding...|5|The seafood at POB was fresh, well cooked and just delicious. We had the POB seafood appetizer...YUM. Then the mussels in cream sauce and coconut shrimp. All outstanding. The seared tuna with seasame seeds were perfection and so were the Chilean Sea Bass and Block Island Swordfish. Well paired with their sides. We would go back again...particularly on Sun night when it is somewhat less of a vibrant bar scene (we are more the quiet foodie types). Great meal!!!
August 25, 2015|Would not return|2|The room has a nice feel but the food was not memorable and I would not recommend this place. Sorry.

We would be much further along if it wasn't for Providence Oyster Bar because we keep having to go back! ... We love their spider sushi roll with King Crab and their coconut shrimp appetizer. Seafood here is always fresh and delicious!
August 2, 2015|A great find at Providence Oyster Bar|5|On recommendation from a friend, we decided to try Providence Oyster Bar. I am so glad we chose to dine there. From the moment we walked in, I knew it was going to be a great experience. The waitress was very friendly and courteous. We sat at a spacious table and were pleasantly surprised by the great selection of wines. We chose the the lobster wontons to start and they were fantastic. My husband and I had the sea bass. It was outstanding and very fresh. The chowder was also a hit with our entire family. I can't wait to go back again on our next visit to Providence!
August 1, 2015|Hopping bar scene|5|We come to this restaurant often for the great oysters, fun bar scene & excellent service. The waitstaff is consistent & knowledge. The food options are solid & the whole setting is just fun. Highly recommended

July 11, 2015|Disappointed|2|Once a restaurant we really enjoyed but on this visit the waiter was way below the level one might expect at a fine dining restaurant. A polite conversation with the manager on our way out was acknowledged as if he did not care....won't be back anytime soon.

June 19, 2015|Oysters galore|4|We had a good experience at the Providence Oyster Bar. We enjoyed the Oyster platter with oysters from all over and the lobster mac & cheese was fabulous. Layla was an excellent server and everyone enjoyed their meal. The only disappointment was that they were out of our wine of choice. We would come back.
June 13, 2015|Great seafood.  Expensive.|4|We had a wonderful meal - both of us enjoying a seafood specialty for the evening. Nicely presented, nicely prepared. Flavorful, without masking the taste of the fish. A bit pricey, though.
June 11, 2015|Date night OK|4|We started with Oysters Rockefeller, nothing spectacular. Also shared the mozzarella salad that was nicely prepared although a little heavy handed with a very sweet balsamic dressing. Enjoyed our dinner entrees; the scallops were nicely seared and accompaniments were fresh and tasty. Again a little heavy on the salt seasoning of the scallops. My husband ordered the sesame crusted tuna that was very creative, accompanied by several seafood filled fried dumplings and dipping sauce. It was cooked to perfection (rare) . The service was attentive. Would ordinarily have ordered a second cocktail but wasn't thrilled with their version of a Cosmopolitan, it tasted bitter (too much old lime juice) and very little vodka content. My husband's martini was also a little skimpy in the flavor department. Would probably try this place again, would like tyo sample other entrees and stick with wine from the bar
May 22, 2015|Seen better|3|Went for early dinner which was mistake due to packed bar during happy hour and very noisy. Food better than average, but sides waited too long at the pass waiting for mains and were served cold. They were prepared new but dinner nearly finished when they arrived. I would recommend, but not go back until I tried other restaurants in town.

May 10, 2015|Wonderful Brunch!!!|5|Shrimp and grits were delicious. Such a nice change from the typical brunch menu that you find everywhere. I highly recommend the Oyster Bar
May 8, 2015|Excellent food and service. I'll definitely return|4|Food, service, menu were all top notch. It's a small neighborhood place but that is not a negative. I would highly recommend it and certainly go back.
May 7, 2015|Excellent food and service|5|Excellent food and service
April 25, 2015|The place was hopping. The food outrageous.|5|The little necks with chorizo and saffron were off the hook. My sister had the paella and it was very flavorful, I had the lobster saute, the lobster was cooked to perfection. I say this is a gem in the neighborhood because I think Federal Hill is 90% Italian restaurants and they all look amazing but this really stands out for fresh over the top seafood.

Dined on April 18, 2015|The oysters were delicious!|5|I went there with four people. Every entree was a piece of art on the plate. I turned my jacket into 97 napkins it was so good. All of their seafood was so fresh you would've sworn it swam up to the table.
April 18, 2015|Perfect venue for the occasion|5|The Providence Oyster Bar is the perfect location for a romantic dinner or a celebration. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the menu is spectacular for those that enjoy seafood. The prices are excellent for a four star experience, and the service is impeccable. Our reservation was absolutely incredible and we will certainly return on a regular basis.
April 17, 2015|Great Food|4|The food and service at Providence Oyster Bar were excellent. The staff were very attentive and easy to talk to. My water glass was always filled and empty dishes were removed immediately. The manager walked around to assure that guest were happy and satisfied. My experience there was overall great! The only drawback is finding parking and the bar was packed so it was kind of noisy for a romantic dinner. I would highly recommend this place.
April 9, 2015|Great find!|5|Found this place which was a very short walk from the Hilton Hotel in Providence. This find in the Federal Hill area was a real gem of a place. It served delicious oysters, but also sushi and other tapas type items. The place is smallish, but not tiny, and had a vibrant bar and good menu. It is nestled in an area where there are a lot of good restaurants, in what seemed like a mainly Italian section of the city. Extremely cute area for foodies. We were visiting Brown University on a college tour and I was glad that we ended up staying at this end of Providence. Went with my teenager to Providence Oyster Bar, and she loved the atmosphere and the food. Would definitely come back here!

March 29, 2015|Great Clams|5|The clam sampler was excellent which had three different types of clams. If you can, come for happy hour at the bar, most everything on the menu was $6, including a lobster roll sandwich. The oyster were $1 a piece. Excellent bar scene, bartenders were friendly and efficient. Get there early, stools fill up fast.
March 23, 2015|Great night!|4|Went to the Oyster bar with my wife for her birthday on a Monday night so it was quiet and not really too busy. The food was very good and the service was even better! They have a great Appy hour at the bar, so I had never eaten there for a sit down dinner before, but I was very pleased with the experience! We will be back! Do yoursef a favor and get the Lobster Sauté , they give you a ton of lobster!
March 13, 2015|Small space, great food|5|Clearly a after work, neighborhood bar, as the bar area was packed. The good was great. Scallops wrapped in bacon had a bit too much syrup and therefore stuck to the teeth for too long. Scallops and butternut squash risotto was exquisite. Fish and chips were good, nothing special though. Service was great, and they willing let us switch tables to get away from the vibrant bar scene. Oh, and they sat us right away eventhough we were at least 30 minutes early!
February 27, 2015|Best seafood in Providence?|4|There are bigger seafood restaurants in Providence, and probably even some with bigger reputations, but it is hard to find seafood better than at the Providence Oyster Bar. Great raw oysters from across New England and Canada, and the local swordfish and sea bass were cooked to perfection. We grabbed a table up front near the bar, where the energy level was high throughout the night. Highly recommended for a night out on Federal Hill.
February 21, 2015|Always delivers|5|A local gem. Particularly great for seafood lovers. A favorite.
January 24, 2015|Good food, service. Cocktails not.|4|Yummy good and nice, attentive service. The wine list is substantial, perhaps that's why the cocktails were so disappointing--they're not commonly requested? Nevertheless, that was the only downside. They were weak and just unpolished. The food was delicious & the servers & hostess were very professional and friendly.
January 23, 2015|Great experience!|4|Fun inviting atmosphere. Waiter was perfect! Manager came by twice to check that we were enjoying the experience. The appetizers, entrees,desserts, and drinks were all tastefully presented and delicious. It was our first time dining here and we shall return!
January 21, 2015|Outstanding & Excetptional|5|Happy Hour is outstanding, both in choices and quality of food. Dinner was exceptional; food and service excellent!
January 19, 2015|Best ever|5|The calamari was the best I have ever had anywhere. The pickled cucumbers mixed in were a great touch as was the wasabi aioli!

January 16, 2015|Great Restaurant Wk Experience|4|Came in for Restaurant Week which can be a make or break for some restaurants. Was SUPER impressed that a half dozen oysters on the half shell were part of their pre fixe menu offerings and happily took advantage- they were great! Everyone in our four person party ordered something different and all were pleased with their meal. One person had even been to the restaurant the night prior and was so happy with the experience, he was the one that suggested we return that day. Out of the three desserts they offered, one was out of supply and they had to substitute their listed strawberry mousse for chocolate. This was disappointing, but the waitress, upon witnessing two of us distress over this, managed to happily surprise us at dessert time by rustling up a couple remaining strawberry mousse servings, which was delightful! The manager came around to check on things and even recognized the guy in our party that had been the night before. Great service overall. Only warning is that if you plan to grab a drink or wait at the bar area ahead of eating, it is a VERY narrow area so if you don't have a seat, you're constantly moving to let people pass and it's a nightmare! They're great about transferring your tab to your table once you sit, so at least that eases the logistics slightly. Overall, a happy and pleasant dining experience. I'll happily return.
January 16, 2015|Seafood Meets Italian|4|Great raw bar. Tried the Oyster Shooter. Wow. But, the best surprise was the Ciapinno. Think it was the best I've ever had. Lots and lots of fish. Perfect for a wicked cold night.

December 6, 2014|Amazing Meals!|5|Enjoyed Dinner Saturday night for Hubby's birthday. He sampled as much seafood as he could enjoying the P.O.B. Platter, and Seafood Casserole. I am more needy due to a Gluten Allergy, but our server reassured me that the kitchen could easily work around my challege. I enjoyed delicious Long Island Duck Breast with Mushroom Risotto and substituted the crispy artichoke hearts for fabulous Broccoli Rabe. Both the Creme Brule and the Cheesecake (for hubby) were also outstanding. Our drinks, wine and beer were all excellent too. We look forward to returning to P.O.B. very soon!

November 19, 2014|Superb wasabi calamari. Moles frites and swordfish|5|Unique delicious wasabi calamari. Moles frites with bacon with white wine cream sauce. Yummy to the last drop. Swordfish with lobster mashed potatoes, good flavor and firm texture. Definitely overall big hit.
November 12, 2014|My favorite place in Providence|5|This place never disappoints. I brought four co-workers to POB for dinner and they LOVED it. The food was great and the wine list was impressive. Lots of good choices at a reasonable price. We sat at the bar and the service was terrific. They made us feel like VIPs.
November 9, 2014|Yummy Fresh Seafood/Great Find|5|An excellent find. The service was great and the seafood extremely fresh and well prepared. Highly recommend the R.I Clam Chowder and New England Clam Chowder, as well as the baked stuffed lobster and lobster mac and cheese!! Great Bloody Mary's too!!
November 8, 2014|Service on point|5|Food was excellent. Service was on point from the time I walked in the door to the time I left.
November 7, 2014|Bad start, nice recovery|4|Bad start was being overlooked for 30 minutes after seating. Hand off to server fumbled. Our table conversation filled the time, but this should not happen and we had to flag someone down to correct. The manager made good with complementary salads, wine and desert, and the food was excellent. We would go back but make sure we have a server to greet us earlier.
November 7, 2014|Loved the oysters|4|Stopped in for dinner and was impressed. The food was all very good and the service was great. They have a nice selection of oysters which you can mix and match. The space is long and narrow which makes the bar area seem tight. There is a barrier that runs (almost) the length of the restaurant separating the bar from the dining area, however, I would not want to sit on the bar side of the dining area as people at the bar place their plates and drinks right above your eye level.
November 4, 2014|Best seafood Resturant in RI|5|Has much more than seafood, but is exceptional in that category...my wife raves about the baked stuffed lobster and I always order the swordfish...both cooked to perfection, and an affordable wine list to boot. We don't go often enough

October 17, 2014|Very Good|4|I will be returning. The lobster was delicious and the oysters were great.
September 30, 2014|Another excellent meal|5|My second time at the POB, and another excellent meal. Pasta w swordfish in cream sauce was perfect! Service by Nick was impeccable. Even the valet, Tony, treated me like an honored member of the family. My only quibble: the choice and volume level of the music wasn't apprpriate for my taste or, I suspect, for any of the other guests not in their 20s.
September 29, 2014|Wonderful. Great service and great food....|5|Wonderful. Great service and great food. We'll return whenever we're next in Providence
September 20, 2014|Fabulous food. Fun atmosphere|5|We visit Providence once a year and eating here is always a must. Our waitress actually remembered us from last year and was so attentive and fun. My friend and I shared the paella, it was delicious and plenty of food. Anther friend had the halibut special which he said was fantastic. Our appetizers of raw bar selections and calimari were perfect and not too filling. We will be back next year!!
September 20, 2014|As always - food is excellent!|4|Brought some newbies to this restaurant and they were very happy with their food choices. The Chilean Sea Bass in particular was well received, and the staff was nice enough to modify the risotto to meet a non-mushroom requirement.
September 14, 2014|Delicioius food|3|"The food was very good, service was fine but it was quite noisy. When I made the reservation, i included that we were celebrating my granddaughters first ""real"" job after graduating from URI last May. They didn't do anythinh extra or mention the occasion."
August 16, 2014|Great Little Place!|5|Almost always when we visit Federal Hill in Providence for the weekend, we eat at the Oyster Bar. It is small, but has a nice atmosphere, the service is always very attentive and the food very good as well, we usually have dinner on Saturday night and then sometimes go back for lunch on Sunday. I highly recommend.
August 10, 2014|great service!|5|This place was recommended by a friend who used to live in Providence, and it was definitely worth it! The food was amazing--the moules frites appetizer was one of the best mussel dishes I've ever had. The bacon wrapped scallop salad was delicious, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The service was great--our waiter was attentive and nice, and the bus boys consistently kept our water glasses full. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves seafood!
Dined on August 9, 2014|Federal Hill Retreat|4|"The Ouster Bar is fantastic. It's our second ""go-to"" restaurant in Providence. The food and atmosphere are wonderful and I've never failed to have a anything but satisfaction when I done here."

August 2, 2014|great evening|4|We sat at a table in the far end of the restaurant. Great table, nice level of noise so that we all were able to hear each other talk easily. generous portions. Especially liked the lobster wontons. Nice selection on the menu. Water glasses were always full. Great timing and attention from wait staff
July 27, 2014|Birthday dinner|4|"Had to request that A/C be turned down. Had to prod waiter to ""move things along,"" as one of our party had a train to catch. It was an expensive dinner. On the positive side, the food was great, and everyone seem to enjoy their entrees. The seafood was very fresh. Service was inconsistent, but mostly attentive."
July 17, 2014|Excellent raw bar;|5|Excellent raw bar; the main reason why I drive to Providence is for appi hour.
July 13, 2014|Classic New England Fare w/ a twist|5|We came here with our family on a Sunday night. The restaurant is long and fairly narrow with a long bar on the left side, four person booths lined up along the right wall, and tables in between. It was busy but not crowded. The service was very attentive and allowed us to order in waves as our chatty group couldn't make ay decisions. The oysters were (expectedly) terrific. As were the maple-espresso glazed scallops wrapped in bacon. The cioppino was HUGE and definitely could have served two. One person tried the sushi, which was also quite good. We would certainly come back, though now that we've eaten our way through the menu we might order a bit less when we return.
July 10, 2014|wonderful evening|5|Some family from Texas came visiting and we wanted to treat them to an upscale new england dining experience, Providence style. Providence Oyster Bar delivered! Most ordered off the Restaurant Week menu (great timing!) some the regular menu. None were disappointed. Every meal was superb. The atmosphere was very comfortable (party of 8) and the service was impeccable. If I'm expecting to drop a considerable sum on a dining experience, I better walk away happy that I did. I left elated.
July 7, 2014|We always have an enjoyable early evenin...|5|We always have an enjoyable early evening dinner when we come here. The menu offers good seafood choices. It is close to home so we don't have to drive to Matunuck to get oysters. They are really fresh here.
July 6, 2014|Overdone|3|Our shrimp and asparagus pasta dish was overdone on both counts.
June 28, 2014|Disappointed but still delicious|3|Ordered a steak medium rare and it came out rare. In fairness, they offered to cook it longer however for $37.00, the expectation is that my steak is going to come out the way I order it.
June 27, 2014|Very pleased|5|The food was excellent, as was the service. Nice Atmosphere. A little pricey, but overall a great experience.
June 21, 2014|Expected more!|3|Was our 34th wedding anniversary, reservation made over a week in advance. No special attention was given to us or our table. Not even a free drink, or a shrimp, or even a visit to our table by manager or chef. Food was excellent but would not recommend this restaurant for any special occasion. they did not go out of they're way to make it a special one. I expected more!
June 16, 2014|Great Staff, incredible food!|5|We went for the oysters and were surprised by how many varieties they had. We tried a platter of a dozen mixed and they all came labeled (something a pricier seafood place nearby doesn't even do) and then had soup and salad. The food was amazing! The staff was very un-rushed and helpful and even the valet parking guy went out of his way to make sure we could go stroll around the hill after and be able to get to our car when we were ready to go. We will definitely go back to this small, well-appointed place with a great atmosphere!
June 15, 2014|Loved it|5|Great food and service. What more could you ask for?
June 7, 2014|Oysters and more!|4|We read the many positive reviews and decided to try it out. There were 11 varieties of oysters that night and we settled on 2. The red wine mignonette was a nice touch! Our meals were beautifully presented and though my cod was a tad overcooked and dry, it was delicious. Next time I will try the sushi options as I saw several tables enjoying them. If you want a special seafood dining option to the Italian restaurant dominated Federal Hill scene, I would highly recommend The Oyster Bar.

May 30, 2014|Providence Oyster Bar|5|This restaurant has an exquisite selection of seafood and never disappoints. Again this weekend it was fabulous!
May 25, 2014|ok local food|3|oysters were fresh. Steamed lobster was dried out, i believe they cook it open and when served it was too chewy. On this night, given it was graduation wknd, they ran out of bread and service was a little slow. It's ok, but i'm sure tehre are better restaurants for these prices and fresh food.
May 23, 2014|Superb seafood|5|If you like excellent seafood this is your place, from multiple kinds of oysters to a fabulous lobster (or lobster roll, or lobster mashed potatoes--don't miss these), you'll love the food. Fabulous happy hour! Great neighborhood feel.
May 22, 2014|one of our favorites in Providence|4|We have been visiting Providence at least once and often twice a year while our daughter has been a student at Brown. POB remains one of our favorite restaurants. The oysters are among the best we've had anywhere in the US...only Hog Island in San Francisco competes. A few of our other favorites include the cod bianco and steamed littlenecks (Cannellini beans, sweet Italian sausage, rabe). POB knows what it does well and does just that.
May 18, 2014|Amazing seafood!|5|Largest selection of seafood I have seen, and enough items for non-seafood lovers to enjoy.
May 14, 2014|lunch|4|Lunch date with friend, took advantage of halibut/risotto special. Delicious!! Good service.
May 12, 2014|Disappointing|2|High quality ingredients cooked to average quality results. Nothing was completely bad, but nothing was memorable either, and the price was very high. Seafood was fresh and high-quality, but preparations were heavy handed and there was no subtlety or imagination. I would not return since for the same costs one can get a phenomenal meal in several other Providence restaurants. Too bad, since I was hoping to find a great local seafood place that isn't a chain.
May 10, 2014|consistently awesome|5|We have been going to the POB since it first opened and have never been disappointed. The menu is usually the same, but the specials are creative and intriguing. The freshest seafood around can be enjoyed here.
May 9, 2014|Outstanding|5|we never left the starters side of the menu service & food were great
May 7, 2014|Whoa!|5|From the time I made the reservation to valet bringing around my car to leave, the service was excellent. The restaurant is in a great location. The restaurant only allows you to reserve for a maximum party of 8. But I ended up having 9 people and the hostess didn't even sweat it. The dining area is pretty compact and I was nervous that our party of 9 wouldn't fit comfortably, but that was not the case. We were sat near the kitchen and I always smell foul kitchen mats when in other restaurants, but I didn't here. I even forgot how close we were to it. The waitress was super friendly & on point. Her tip was included but she didn't act like it. She definitely earned every penny. Valet is free which is great. AND THE FOOD IS AWESOOOOOME!
April 30, 2014|business lunch|4|table for six. food very good, service polite and attentative but a bit slow in delivering lunch. Our server just started. I would go back however.. definately worth the trip
April 26, 2014|Nice place. |4|Service was good as well as the food. Drinks were very good. Atmosphere was energetic. It was a little noisy and our table was about six inches from the kitchen. Lots of kitchen noise. If you are going to come here, make sure you make a reservation and ask not to sit near the kitchen.
April 23, 2014|Great Service & 9 Kinds of Oysters|5|We found this online and am so glad we did! The service was outstanding and our waitress made the experience so amazing we came back the next night too! We learned that they served 9 kinds of oysters and their wine list was varied. I would recommend their happy hour....$1 per oyster is a great price. Bring your friends, but maybe not your kids, for a fun evening out!
April 20, 2014|GREAT FOOD, GREAT PLACE|5|Must say, the overall experience was great. Went for Easter brunch and the food and service was so good we went back for dinner. BC oysters a MUST try, great wine, great bar...
March 30, 2014|Too expensive|3|Food was good but way too expensive. $15 for 6 small oysters, and $36 for mostly calamari and mussels. Got me once, wont get me again
March 29, 2014|All around great restaurant!!|5|Oyster Bar is consistently delicious. The quality of the oysters never fails. They make the best ginger gimlet as well. Great night out with my husband.
March 22, 2014|Oysters in RI|5|Whenever I visit downtown Providence, I make it a point to visit the Providence Oyster Bar. The oysters are fresh, great variety. The rest of the menu is heaven! Every entree is great! The swordfish is amazing! Lively and busy bar. make reservations!
March 15, 2014|Nice Find In Federal Hill.|5|As anyone knows who has been to Federal Hill in Providence, Rhode Island, there are many restaurants and bars to choose from. The Oyster Bar is a nice spot to go for dinner. The menu has some great choices, along with the specials of the evening. The service was super!!! Roast Beet salad was wonderful. Chilean Sea Bass, very good, as well as, the duck. I was a little scared about the cherry demi glaze that was served with the duck, so I ordered it on the side, it was delicious!!! So, when in Federal Hill, check out The Oyster Bar on Atwells Avenue, I highly recommend!
March 15, 2014|Delicious experience|5|This was our first visit.. Food was outstanding! Lobster wontons, seared tuna, Pt Judith Calamari. Definitely coming back again!
March 14, 2014|Great food and service, but pricey|4|The place was a little bit noisy, but not too bad. The seafood was fresh and delicious and the menu had a lot of interesting offerings. The service was superb. The bill was a bit of an eye-popper!
March 13, 2014|Business Lunch with excellent food|4|Had lunch here at 12 noon one day (they open at 12 so don't expect much going on when you arrive promptly. The lunch menu had a nice selection of seafood sandwiches and entrees and I had the Oyster Po'Boy Sandwich. Oysters were super fresh and clean and succulent. My business associate had the blackened swordfish which was a nice portion and he remarked how great the taste was. Overall very good, waiter was good but was a little green around the edges (little confused on the menu) but was extremely nice and wanted to please
March 9, 2014|BRUNCH!!|5|This was the most delicious Sunday brunch I ever could have hoped for. The design-your-own bloody mary option is fun and accessible, and was a great addition to everything else I ate. As a table of four we split the stuffed french toast (seasonal stuffing: bananas foster!!) which was divine, and the perfect shared sweet addition to the rest of our meal. I also had a half dozen oysters from the raw bar, of which the local (RI) options were not the greatest, but the others were delicious. Finally I split the crabcakes benedict with my mother, which was absolutely perfect. The crabcakes are thick, warm, and perfectly spiced, the eggs seem very fresh, the sauce is great, and it's served on toasted french bread which is delicious. SO GREAT.
March 2, 2014|Good Restaurant|4|First off, the food was outstanding! The hollandaise sauce is one of the best I've had, and the eggs benedict were very good. One thing to watch out for is the price. Two people at Brunch...$100! That's a bit much for brunch (and it wasn't a buffet). The other complaint I had was the service. We waited 10 minutes, and had to go to the manager, before a server visited our table. However, once the server came over, she was great! I do recommend this restaurant, if you're not watching out for your cash.
March 1, 2014|Very nice|4|The food was great. Varied, fresh, interesting. Ambiance of a big city restaurant, excellent service. Highly recommend.
Dined on February 28, 2014|First timer!|4|The best food I've had in a long time! I won't be a regular as I thought it was really expensive. Down side was the bar was so overcrowded we couldn't sit and have a drink before dinner. We tried to stand but it's such a narrow area our drinks were spilling from people banging into us. Our server was unsmiling and looked like he wanted to be somewhere else! The hostess was lively and the bartender was friendly even though he was overwhelmed ! We appreciated that. Will go back!
February 15, 2014|great for Valentine's Day|5|Perfect atmosphere for a romantic date night. There were rose petals on the table and everything.
February 12, 2014|Always great oysters|4|This was the fourth or fifth time I have been to the Oyster Bar and I have enjoyed every visit. The seafood is wonderful, although yesterday I was disappointed with the pasta. Service is prompt and friendly. Valet parking a big plus since parking in the neighborhood is so difficult.
February 8, 2014|Providence's Oyster Bar|5|The service was outstanding. From the valet, coat check, to the waitress. A+ & the food matched the service. OUTSTANDING!!! Price wise I was pleasantly surprised. Very fair. I'd recommend this restaurant to any and everyone.
February 7, 2014|Rekindled Affection|5|Haven't been there for a while and it was only for lunch, but my wife and I went last night and it was such a good experience. In addition to the service, food, and quality being excellent, the atmosphere is very lively and the we'll have to experience the fun looking bar scene the next time around. Be assured that we will be back soon!!!!
February 4, 2014|Great place|5|Looked this place up online and saw the great reviews so decided to try it for my boyfriends birthday. Staff and waitress were all polite and answered all questions. Food was excellent! Definitely would recommend.
January 26, 2014|Awesome and Consistant|5|This is a favorite- the Tuna is amazing. Everyone in our group loved the choices and their fish was cooked perfectly.
January 25, 2014|Excellent Food and Great Service|5|My first trip to the Providence Oyster Bar was in January, 2014, and it won't be my last. While the food is very expensive, it truely was wonderful. We started with a sampler of oysters and some shooters (tequila shot with an oyster inside). For my main course, I had scallops with spinach and polenta - my friend had sole with wild rice. Both meals were outstanding.
January 18, 2014|Good food, but cold|2|We arrived a little early for our reservation, but were seated within a few minutes. It was a table in the back . I asked the waiter if the back door was open because it was freezing. He replied there was a draft from the back door but there was a curtain to insulate against it. The door must be left open for ventilation purposes because it was really cold. It could not have been just drafty.I think our table was really the only one affected, The front of the restaurant was warm. I don't think that particular table should be used during this season. Food was very good, but unfortunately our experiences was affected but the uncomfortable temperature.
January 18, 2014|Saturday night dinner|3|Restaurant was much too noisy to carry on a conversation. The half wall separating the dining room is far from adequate.
January 10, 2014|Amazing seafood|5|We went during Providence restaurant week. The oysters were delicious and the wasabi ginger calamari was the best calamari we've ever had. The salmon entree was fantastic and light. The bistro siloin was a little overcooked but still tasted great. Overall we want to go back and try the sushi. The regular menu looks amazing.
January 10, 2014|Always a wonderful experience|5|My favorite restaurant in RI. From beginning to end it is always a great experience.
January 9, 2014|One of my favorites!|5|This restaurant is one of my favorites on the hill. The wasabi ginger calamari is amazing, I will keep going back just for that. I have tried many other items on the menu as well and everything is delicious. They also have great sushi. I will definitely be back soon.
December 28, 2013|Outstanding!|5|We sat at the bar. Great service. Oysters to die for! The tuna was outstanding. You can share apps and one entree, more than enough food for two people.
December 21, 2013|Consistently Excellent|5|This is the third or fourth time I have dined @ POB and every meal has been great. Poseidon Platter was a great starter for the shellfish eaters, with all the different Oysters clearly identified and beautiful King Crab meat in the center of the platter. Ginger-Wasabi fried calamari was a great change of pace from traditional RI calamari. Sesame seared tuna with lobster wontons is conssitently excellent. Great mixed drinks, although I always go for the jalapeno and cilantro tequila drink. We were too full of seafood and shellfish for dessert. Not a cheap night out, but always worth the price.
December 19, 2013|holiday lunch with outside consulta|4|I have never left here with the least bit of disappointment, all the way thru the valet, great experience and the freshest seafood.
December 13, 2013|Bday dinner|5|Overall it was a nice experience despite the fact that we were sitting so close to the bar I felt like some times the patrons were screaming in my ear. (Really folks? It's a classy joint - inside voices only.) Anyhow, I had been there several times before. The service was more than I Could ask for as our server and the staff were so attentive. As soon as I dropped my knife (on accident) or the bowls were filled to capacity of shells, someone was always there to help get a new knife/bowl. Hubs and I had the Moules and frites which were a little bland compared to other times, but other than that the blue point oysters and stuffed lobster were fantastic. Hubs ordered the clam bake and did not complain. We will definitely come back.
November 25, 2013|Great food, Pleasant atmosphere|5|Went with friends to sample the rock crab featured in an online ad. Disappointing that they had run out the day before and had none available. Oyesters were great. Don't bother with the Alaskan King Crab, it's tasteless and pretty expensive. Two of us had the Sea Bass and two had the Swordfish for entrees. Food was fabulous and portions were very generous. Had wine by the glass which was good and the selection was reasonable. Ambience was nice and waitstaff was very good. Highly recommend the Providence Oyster Bar for any occasion.
November 16, 2013|spectacular food. Quick, knowledgab|5|spectacular food. Quick, knowledgable and very friendly service.
November 15, 2013|I had the coconut shrimp starter|5|I had the coconut shrimp starter and the baked scallops entree. Both absolutely delicious! Would go back in a heartbeat
November 8, 2013|Excellent as Always!|5|Another great dinner at the Providence Oyster Bar. Food is always great and service (with Kelly) is alway OUTSTANDING! We'll be back again soon.
October 19, 2013|Providence Oyster Bar what a pearl!|5|I took my husband for a birthday dinner after checking out the Jackolantern Spectacular and the food was outstanding! They had a full raw bar and sushi bar featuring local fresh caught seafood from RI. It was delicious especially the chilean sea bass and I'm not a big fish eater! I actually ordered a NY strip and it was out of this world and I go frequently to Peter Lugers in NY and am hard to please. They also have these delicious parmesean truffle fries OMG you can not stop eating them. If you are ever in Providence stop into this little pearl in the heart of the Italian section you will not be disappointed!
October 19, 2013|Great seafood on Federal Hill|5|Amongst all the mediocre/good Italian restaurants on Federal Hill, the Providence Oyster Bar stands out as a wonderful, casual seafood restaurant with a delightful variety of seafood offerings. The oyster sampler was terrific, especially the local Rhode Island variety, and their baked bay scallops serves to remind one why they are so prized over their larger, more abundant sea scallop cousins. More casual than Hemenway's (another fine seafood option in Providence), with a more focused menu, the Providence Oyster Bar has immediately become my favorite restaurant on Federal Hill.
October 11, 2013|Oysters--and more!|5|A very difficult menu. Oysters, yes, but so much more tantalizing fare, it was very difficult to make a choice. We had a group of three, and everyone enjoyed their food. The only down-note was that the sirloin was so large, it was not evenly cooked, and what had been requested as medium rare was half uncooked.
October 5, 2013|Service- from the valet, hostess|5|Service- from the valet, hostess and wait staff- is right on. Wait staff is knowledgeable and attentive without being intrusive. Varied menu with something for all tastes. Well worth going.
September 28, 2013|Excellent food choices|4|We went to the Oyster Bar because we are seafood lovers and there were many choices and were not disappointed. The menu item of swordfish with vegetables and lobster mashed potatoes was so tasty and perfectly cooked. We wish we lived closer than four and a half hours from there but will surely return when visiting in Providence again
September 28, 2013|food good but rushed|3|I had expected by the name - oyster bar -- that raw and close to fresh would be the theme. The food was good, but for me cooked with a 'heavy hand' which 'dated' the entrees. While the meal and ambience was enjoyable, the service staff was pressing to get the food out and cleared and us out the door in the least amount of time available. If I had not purposefully sipped my drink at the end of the meal - I think we might have mae it thru an entire dinner with appetizers and entrees in under 45 minutes -- which for me is akin to a fast food experience. Please slow it down so we can enjoy the ambience.
September 28, 2013|Great food and service|4|I had made reservations for 2 then minutes later friends called and wanted to join in. Although the on-line reservation showed the next 4 seating available an hour and a half later, a quick phone call and we were immediately accommodated at our original time. The service was great (a lot of special requests and revisions to dishes ordered) all handled very graciously. we had a variety of dishes; seafood, steak & chicken, all very good, and served at a relaxed, unrushed pace. We'll definitely be back!
September 28, 2013|Packed because it is worth it|4|The Oyster Bar has a great special for appetizers at the bbar from 5- 6:30 PM. Wonderful deals on oysters clams and appetizers. Having been ther only on Saturday nights I can say that reservations are a must. Any number of people were turned away so take my advice get a reservation. Sea food was excellent over our three visits and a dozen meals the only less than positive comment was the rice in the paella. Not the sea food but only the rice. Calamari mussels all good rice overly salty. Service at the bar and the table was excellent. Despite the full house they were all attentive, personable, and efficient. Valet parking is available right in front of the restaurant and in this part of town is a must. Will we go back? Absolutely.
September 6, 2013|Great time|5|Thank you - we had a great time. Outstanding food and service. We hope to have another experience in the very near future.
September 6, 2013|Loved the menu|5|I would go back just because I would order just about anything on the menu. Great selection of seafood and other dishes.
August 22, 2013|Classic New England|4|When you choose an Oyster Bar in New England you expect certain things: an old, brick and wood atmosphere, waiters in black and white with long, white aprons, all the classic choices in addition to oysters -- clams, mussels, lobster rolls, and this place does not disappoint. Just what we wanted. Food was delicious, wait staff friendly and helpful when choosing among all the best of New England.
August 17, 2013|The Oyster Bar is GOOD. It's|3|The Oyster Bar is GOOD. It's a little too brightly lit making the atmosphere a bit stark and cold. The Sushi staff is amazing and will bend over backwards to accommodate. I will go back for a second try.
August 17, 2013|POB is a wonderful restaurant|4|"POB is a wonderful restaurant in the heart of Federal Hill. Oysters are ""in"" right now and they have plenty to choose from"
August 17, 2013|Very pleasantly surprised.|5|Very pleasantly surprised. First time customer, food was fantastic, service superb. Will definitely go back
August 3, 2013|Good overall experience|4|Celebrated my father's birthday, we had a part of 5. Service was prompt as we were seated right away and had a great spot in the back. Given that the place was small the tables were a little tight but not really a bother sitting in the booth. Waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Sushi for an app was good, the lobster wontons were the best!! Entrees we had split a paella which was stock full of mussels and seafood. The swordfish with the green dill sauce and lobster mash was ok, but the sauce was a little much. The pasta dish with lobster, spinach and tomatoes was hands down the favorite.
August 3, 2013|Best in RI|5|My wife and I have been to many restaurants in Ri and have decided that the Oyster Bar is the best ever!! We look forward to going every time and dont even want to take a chance at another place that may not be as fantastic.
August 2, 2013|Definitely an energetic place!|4|Definitely an energetic place! Great Happy Hour with Happy Hour specials at the bar. For dinner, the seafood was outstanding.
July 27, 2013|great oysters!|4|I had oysters for an appetizer and they were very good.....then I had striped bass for my main course and it was even better. My wife had a beet salad and scallops......both excellent. Our table was a little small and lit dimly but the chairs were exceptionally comfortable. The valet service for parking was great too.
July 20, 2013|First Timers|4|Have walked by this restaurant on Atwells a zillion times. Always seemed a bit odd to see oysters being shucked two doors away from Venda Ravioli. Took an out of town couple there based on their online menu and all 4 of us had splendid food. I don't think there was one miss. Ladies had grilled sword over risotto and both said was very good. I had Sesame tuna and it was a great plate. Very nice piece of tuna cooked properly and served in two pieces and not sliced up as so many are. Baby bok choy was great as was lobster ravs. Would/will go back to this place in a heartbeat. Also, servers were very knowledgeable and extremely pleasant. Was just a very nice all around dining experience.
Dined on July 20, 2013|lunch with family|4|This was perfect for us, not too formal for the young adults, but a step out of the ordinary. We were impressed with the variety of oysters offered, although only one option was available with the Restaurant Week lunch. The ginger wasabi calamari was very good. There seemed to be a lot of ginger in the cuisine, but each of us enjoyed our selections. Loved the dining room decor.
July 15, 2013|Good food, good service|5|Waitstaff were friendly and prompt. Drinks (I had an old-fashioned) were well made. We had the Poseidon Platter which was quite delicious. Good place to take a date or family.
July 13, 2013|Awesome Experience|4|We went to the Providence Oyster Bar for our anniversary and we had an excellent time. We had made reservations and were seated immediately. The space is small but comfortable and not overly crowded. The wait staff was very responsive and kind. We really appreciated the busboy since he was quick to clear our table between courses. The red pepper dipping sauce for the bread was amazing! The oysters were also great, very refreshing and clean. Our food was excellent and we enjoyed the unique chef's specials. Overall, we truly enjoyed the experience and would come again with friends.
July 13, 2013|Providence Oyster Bar|5|Reservations are recommended because it is a small restaurant and gets booked quickly. Our reservation was at 5:15 and even though they were booked solid that night (waterfire) they gave us a booth and did not hurry us out at all. The bar at that time was already standing room only! If you love seafood of any kind you will find it here, raw or cooked and fresh and delicious!
July 12, 2013|We had a mid afternoon lunch|4|We had a mid afternoon lunch which was quiet and relaxing; however as the afternoon progressed, the bar scene became more alive. Our meals were delicious with the oysters on the half shell particularly noteworthy - fresh and tasty. The entres, both linguini with clams - white & red sauce - were delicious.The red sauce was sweet, yet spicy which was very enjoyable. We would return without hesitation and certainly would recommend Providence Oyster Bar to family & friends.
July 10, 2013|Average food, nice ambiance|3|Food was average -- which was disappointing since I've heard great things. Was excited for the Wasabi Ginger Calamari -- but it turned out to just be regular calamari with pickled ginger and bits of wasabi thrown on top (rather than actually incorporating the ingredients together), which just felt lazy -- and also made the calamari soggy. Disappointing.
July 6, 2013|Tremendous seafood & cocktails.|5|Tremendous seafood & cocktails. I've been to Providence Oyster Bar on a few occasions and have never been disappointed. Food quality & service are always tremendous. Raw bar people in our group went right to the Poseidon platter. Although the price was a little steep at $75, the 12 Poppasquash oysters, 12 cherrystones, 8 jumbo shrimp, and 1/4 lb. of shelled king crab were all incredibly fresh and delicious. Wasabi & cucumber fried calamari was an interesting change from traditional RI calamari and was fried to perfection. My go to entree is the sesame seared Ahi Tuna with Lobster wontons, which never fails, cooked rare it still cuts easily with just a fork. The grilled Swordfish special also got rave reviews. Too full for dessert.
July 5, 2013|Great view and|4|Was here during holiday weekend and hostesses seemed pretty overwhelmed. I heard a number of people complaining regarding mixed up tables / missed names...too bad they also don't have more outdoor seating (the second level really should be used)...food is terrific, and we shared a 3 lb lobster. Crab cakes were also quite good and no complaints.
June 22, 2013|Just okay|3|We went because i wanted ot have oysters. The oyster shoot we good (more of a salty drink really), squid was a bit over cooked and not very tasteful. Sushi was okay, not great but fresh tasting. Free Valet (great service) was appreciated
June 13, 2013|Can't go wrong|5|Another great meal. Service is great! Wish deserts were better but Pastiche is a short walk away! Love it
June 8, 2013|Great Upscale Casual Dining|5|Great Food - Great Atmosphere - Superb Wait Service .. What a Romantic Evening !!
June 8, 2013|all around a great dining exp. BUT!|4|My girlfriend and I both work at a OPEN TABLE TOP 100 RESTAURANT and love to eat at different places recommended by Open Table as often as possible.Overall we enjoyed our night but to be honest we there was one flaw in our evening we made a early reservation because we planned on a being there for a few hours (we enjoy staggering our courses and drinks) we were really looking forward to the Happy Hour Specials as advertised on your web page but when we asked about them we were told its only offered at the Bar so by then all bar seats were taken! we were disappointed, as a Chef and a person who loves to dine it hard to fully enjoy things to follow.Maybe if somewhere on the menu it said Happy Hour at bar only the night would have been PERFECT
June 7, 2013|birthday celebration|4|good food for a birthday celebration. This is my favorite restaurant in Providence and I try to visit as often as I can. The food and service are almost always great. I think this was a bit of an off night all around, but things were still good. The great thing about this place is that even when things are not perfect they are still better than most.
June 7, 2013|A Seafood Standout in Federal Hill|5|Been back 5 times now and never a disappointment. Great oysters (and I'm picky). Creative appetizer and dinner specials. Best of all, the service is always fast, courteous and very friendly no matter how busy they might be. This place is a Providence Gem for sure.
June 1, 2013|Very good at first|3|We went in for appetizers and drinks. We got a table quickly and ordered little necks on the halfshell. They were great but the next day we both had a bit of stomach trouble. I'm used to eating raw shellfish and these were great, yet I can't pinpoint anything else that would have gotten us both uncomfortable.
May 31, 2013|Made the right choice|4|My first time eating here and it won't the the last. All the seafood was fresh and well prepared. Started off the night sitting at the bar having a few drinks and sampling items from the raw bar. Once we sat down the service was excellent, timing of the food in between courses was just right. No complaints on anything from our table.
May 12, 2013|Great Oysters!|4|Loved the local oysters at Providence Oyster Bar. Great brunch menu too.
May 7, 2013|Great Oysters, great menu|4|Had a delightful dinner on a Tuesday night. The food was very good. Sat at a booth near thr bar. Since it was Tuesday, it was busy but not overwhelming busy. I can see how the tables closer to bar may not be able to hear their conversations because of loudness of bar. On a busy night , I would recommend a table towards back of restaurant. All in all, enjoyable night, enjoyable meal.
April 27, 2013|Oyster bar is our favorite|5|Oyster bar is our favorite restaurant. Every time we have gone we love the food, the service is impeccable.
April 27, 2013|Excellent fresh seafood. We|5|Excellent fresh seafood. We were fortunate enough to get there on a Saturday before 6:30 and sat at the bar where we were able to take advantage of their $1 specials for oysters, cherry stones etc. We were a party of six and every entre was different and well prepared. Both specials were ordered and were quite creative combinations. Valet parking is complimentary and a must in this bustling area. Cars came quickly when it was time to leave.
April 19, 2013|We were seated at a table|4|We were seated at a table near the bar. The noise level was disturbing and prohibited conversation at our table. We sat for at least 10 minutes before the waiter showed up. It appeared they were understaffed
April 18, 2013|I normally really enjoy this|4|I normally really enjoy this restaurant but this was an off night. We waited a very long time before a server approached us about taking our drink order and it was not busy. It seems there was a mix up between the hostess and wait staff. Also, as usual, they serve their red wine by the glass far too warm. Otherwise, the food was good.
April 11, 2013|Night out with my sister was|4|Night out with my sister was great - the service was outstanding, beginning with the valet who brought my cellphone into the restaurant after noticing I left it in the console. Waitress was efficient and asked if there were any food alergies after overhearing my sister's comment about avoiding glueten and the chef prepared her dish without using a sauce that contained flour as a thickening agent. The oysters were fresh and the Rockefeller were delicious. The seabass was very good and my only complaint is the skin should have been cooked crisper.
April 7, 2013|I am not a raw shellfish person,|5|I am not a raw shellfish person, but went with a group that were. All raved about their raw bar oysters, littlenecks, cherrystones, and shrimp. There were plenty of choices beyond shellfish. Pt. Judith Calamari was crisp and spicy. Lobster Bisque was decadent, with large chunks of lobster meat. Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna w/ Lobster Wontons was fabulous. Quality of the Tuna was outstanding. Interesting cocktail options, including Pear Martini w/ Amaretto and their twist on the Margarita, with muddled cilantro and jalapenos. Rave reviews for Lobster Roll, Linguine with White Clam Sauce, Chilean Sea Bass, and Blackened Tuna Appetizer. Peanut Butter & Banana Gelato hit the spot for dessert. Definitely a keeper.
April 7, 2013|We've been to the Oyster Bar|5|We've been to the Oyster Bar several times for dinner and never have been disappointed. We were thrilled to find that the Sunday Brunch menu is just as good. Great make-your-own Bloody Mary bar, and the brunch offerings are just as tempting (and delicious) as the dinner menu. The restaurant was surprisingly quiet when we arrived, but started to pick up a bit later in our meal. Definitely recommend for that special brunch out with friends or family.
April 6, 2013|The Oyster Bar never dissapoints;|5|The Oyster Bar never dissapoints; the food is exellent and the staff is great, accommodating, friendly and attentive. Great place!
April 5, 2013|Recently enjoyed dinner here-|5|Recently enjoyed dinner here- the oysters were fantastic and the lobster bisque is one of the better I've ever had. We weren't remotely disappointed!

March 28, 2013|Good food, nice atmosphere.|4|"Good food, nice atmosphere. This was our first time at this restaurant and went with a big group including a couple of kids. There's no kids menu, but they like sush and were able to find something they liked. Everyone was pretty happy with their meals (some definitely more notable than others). Our server was nice, but did not make too much of an effort(a little snooty). He did the bare minimum and that was about it. We had put in the reservation that we were celebrating 3 bdays, but no acknowledgement on that request was addressed, and we didn't want to bother after the server's ""I just want to get this over with"" attitude. Otherwise, overall dining experience was good."
March 25, 2013|Great service and no complaints|5|Great service and no complaints about the food. I ordered one of my favorite cabernets and after she opened the bottle mentioned that someone sometimes ordered the Joseph Phelps Insignia (from next door so it wasn't on their wine list). We switched to that without a problem and had a splendid dinner.

March 14, 2013|Out-of-Towner gets seafood delight!|5|Had an out-of-town visitor who liked seafood, so what was naturally the destination on the hill? POB. Apologies as this review is much later than the visit. I had the special which was out of this world. my special came with mashed potatoes which I would've eaten but one guest loves them so the kitchen switched the spuds to her plate and I was the lucky recepient of some of the finest risotto I've ever had. shared with our mutual guest who was equally impressed. he got the mixed seafood extravaganza and put it away. We all were satisfied and enjoyed every aspect of our visit. kudos to chef, servers, management & the great bartenders there, as well. Don't miss this experience -D
March 14, 2013|One of my favorites|5|Service and food was incredible as always. Can't wait to go back.
March 2, 2013|Our go to place|5|"This is our ""go to"" restaurant in Providence. We had calamari, baked stuffed shrimp, and stuffed sole as a special. Everything was terrific. I love their soups too, but didn't have soup this visit."
March 2, 2013|Really glad we found this place!|4|This was a great find for us! The menu was loaded with attractions, making a choice very difficult. My wife settled on the crab cocktail and then the lobster saute. I had oysters followed by the special bouillabaisse. All my food was delightful; the lobster saute had a strange flavor, hard to identify, not totally delightful. We shared the tiramisu which was fabulous. Our server was perfect; he was attentive but not overly so. We are eager to return soon.
March 1, 2013|Yummy|4|Great pan seared tuna. Raw bar is so good and extremely fresh and chilled. A bit crowded at front door check in. otherwise a great night out to dinner

It was a wonderful experience. I had surf and turf, my boyfriend had the swordfish; he was pleasantly surprised to find lobster in his mashed potatoes while my steak was cooked just right.
February 7, 2013|We had another excellent meal.|4|We had another excellent meal. this time we tried the sushi and found it very good! Oyster Bar is a very good choice for an excellent meal!
February 6, 2013|Good food as always|4|My husband, son and I have eaten at POB many times. We know that it is a dependable spot to go where you are getting the freshest of seafood and a creative chef to make the most of the flavor the seafood has to offer. Great caesar salad, too!
February 2, 2013|Enjoyable, not special|3|I was disappointed in the quality of the RI oysters as well as the shucking. A number of my oysters were still attached to the shell. The linguini and clams were good as well as the lobster bisque, not exceptional. The godfather maki was the highlight. I've been to other oyster bars where the server was eager to explain the subtleties of the different oysters available and was quite knowledgeable. All in all, an enjoyable meal but not special.

January 26, 2013|Ok|4|Food was good. Waiter was less helpful than expected and didn't seem thrilled to be there. We kind if had to pull info about the food out of him.

January 19, 2013|The oysters as you would expect|5|The oysters as you would expect based on the name of the restaurant were out of this world. We participated in the Restaurant week menu and found the selections to be perfect. Definitely going back. The waitress told us that every day from 3-6 they offer $1.00 oysters at the bar --can't wait.
January 18, 2013|It is what the name implies,|3|It is what the name implies, a bar. The fish entrees my wife and I had for dinner were very good as we're the appetizers. The oysters were fresh and perfectly chilled. Unfortunately, we were seated with only a low glass partition separating our table for two from a very lively bar seen. We actually had to ask a bar patron to refrain from extending his drink over the partition and our table. In the future we would select another day of the week to dine and enjoy our otherwise positive dining experience.
January 17, 2013|Restaurant Week|4|"We were very excited to visit the Providence Oyster Bar for Restaurant Week. We were immediately seated when we arrived, even though we were a little early for our reservation. We ordered our drinks and we were given attentive service, until we asked for the Resaurant Week menu. After that, our waiter seemed less interested in us as customers. We were never asked if we wanted another drink. Our water was never filled. We weren't asked if we wanted coffee or tea or another cocktail with our dessert. We were never asked, ""Is there anything else I can get you?"" It was a little unwelcoming and disappointing. Restaurant Week provides an opportunity for people to try out new places, not to feel cheap and unwanted by an establishment."

January 11, 2013|2nd attempt|2|Well this is our first time back here in about two years, but it will perhaps be our last. First was the bake stuffed shrimp which was overcooked and needed to be sent back to the three cooks standing in the kitchen. Along with a great deal of cellphone use among the workers, not to mentation the Lampshade above our table was full of dust, not the seasoning that I wanted on my dinner.

December 31, 2012|cant wait to go again.|4|Went for new years early evening. Had the oysters. Over 10 varieties of oyster and all were fresh. Lobster bisque was rich and creamy and spicy tuna roll melted in mouth. The bar served excellent old fashioneds as well.

November 10, 2012|Outstanding Experience|5|This was my first time at the Providence Oster Bar and I was surprised how well I like it. Even though I generally find hostesses to have an attitude and make me feel like I’m bothering them by showing up, the one at the Providence Oster Bar on Saturday night (11/10/12) appeared genuine and welcoming. Our waiter and his assistant were attentive throughout the meal and provided detailed explanations when asked for recommendations. The food was all outstanding. We started off with the California roll and a chef’s selection of 6 oysters (called Triton Oster Sampler) and both apps were very fresh and nicely presented. The entrees of Chilean Sea Bass and Native Lobster Saute were both delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant.
November 2, 2012|Very noisy. Disappointing|3|Very noisy. Disappointing raw bar selection. Would have liked to see more local seafood on menu. Oysters very fresh and good.
November 1, 2012|Best Providence seafood restaurant|5|My favorite seafood restaurant in Providence. All the appetizers are amazing. Oysters are always fresh and delicious. I would say this is the only place I would go to eat raw oysters. Most of the entrees and specials are on point. This place always satiates my seafood cravings. The service is overall great and the staff is very friendly. They seem to have a vibrant bar scene as well. Have been here many times already and have never been disappointed.
October 6, 2012|Over rated|2|VERY Disappointing. Husband took me here for my birthday for something different, & I wish we had gone somewhere else. We started off w/ the coconut shrimp, it was over cooked and the only thing that made it coconut was the dipping sauce. The shrimp did not appear to have any coconut in the batter. I had the crab cake dinner & when it was delivered I was shocked by how horrible the presentation of the dish was it looked like everything was plopped on the dish like I was at a mom & pop restaurant. Unfortunately the taste of the meal was not any better, crab cake: little flavor & mash potato bland & gooey. Honestly I could have made this at home, and have, with much better flavors. The only thing that would bring me back is the Lobster Bisqu

The only set back was that apparently there was red wine on my chair and I did not noticed it until I got home and my beige slacks were stained! Perhaps a check of the chairs before guests get sitted would be a good idea. However, that incident would not keep me from dinning there again!!

Peter was so kind and very considerate. My brother needed to go to another spot in Providence after our dinner and Peter was really helpful!!
August 4, 2012|Restauarant was a lot darker|4|Restauarant was a lot darker than I thought it was going to be. I expect an oyster bar to be on the water, but I guess its my fault for not having scoped the place better. I don't eat a lot in Providence. The food wasn't as good as in Boston, but I don't think that can be expected.
July 27, 2012|Realt great find!|5|Great food, especially the lobster roll and shrimp tacos!
July 23, 2012|Would not repeat|2|I took a visiting colleaguevisiting from Switzerland to this establishment. She very much wanted lump crabcakes during her visit to RI. I asked the waiter if they had lump crab cakes and he said yes. I even described the lump crab meat to make sure, and again yes. We ordered the crabcakes. They were shredded crab. Horrible. I can buy the same in the frozen section of a Sam's Club. Very dissapointed and would not repeat at this establishment. If the server was honest, we would have ordered something else.

They have an extensive wine list. We had oysters and shrimp cocktail and both were excellent. Our main course was their lobster roll and it too was delicious and packed with lobster meat. Their desserts were good as well. It was an expensive evening but well worth the money for the food received!

We went for an early dinner on a Saturday, early enough that it wasn't busy. We were seated right away. The waiter was just OK. He seemed indifferent to us being there, Not very welcoming. The drinks were very good. There isn't much to look at. Several restaurants on the street offer outdoor dining but not this one. When I made a reservation I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. It would have been nice if they wished her well, brought a cupcake, did anything but it went ignored. My wife wants to return because the food was good, me, it wouldn't be my first choice.

A salmon entree covered in a sweet glaze with mandarin oranges and asparagas with mashed potatoes, a lovely melody in my mouth!!
May 9, 2012|Great Find!|5|The food was fantastic, the ambiance was great, and our waitress knew the menu (and off menu) items like the back of her hand. I'm not sure how many more times I'll make it back to Rhode Island but this Southerner, and all my coworkers, give The Oyster Bar 2 thumbs up.

We paid the same here as we did at Chez Pascale but at the latter place the service, wine list, locally sourced food and experience was much higher quality. This place is fine, like a TGI Fridays for seafood.

March 2, 2012|Go there|4|My initial exeperience at Providence Oyster Bar was lunch with a friend about two weeks ago. I could not stop talking about the excellent fish and shellfish to my husband who is, frankly, difficult to impress. We took two guests with us for dinner last Friday night, and all were beyond delighted with their appetizers and dinner. Also, our server was knowledgeable, very pleasant and kind. (Nicole). The food is outstanding and, obviously, memorable.

January 28, 2012|Great Night of Great Food|5|As a couple, we went to Oyster Bar for our anniversary. The restaurant was busy and boisterous, but our table was ready at our reserved time. It was restaurant week, but our food came out quickly, fresh, and HOT! They also allowed us to take our time with the meal and did not rush food out as if it had been pre-cooked. I definitely recommend the salmon over lentils, and the Mexican Sushi roll. The $30 wine list also helps for people of more moderate incomes. Our desserts were also great, so I would highly recommend this place. The servers were friendly, non-intrusive, attentive, and helpful.

December 17, 2011|Great Food! Great Waitstaff!|5|This was our first time eating at here and the food was amazing. We ordered a lot of seafood; lobster, mussels, clams, etc., and everything was great. I only have two complaints: 1) I didn't get what I ordered. I ate it and enjoyed it nonetheless but they did mess up my order. 2) We reserved a table for two and even though there were other empty tables around us they sat us at a tiny wobbly table closest to the kitchen. If it weren't for the food and the waitstaff being so great, I wouldn't have been so happy about our experience.

November 29, 2011|Not a bad place, just not my fav|3|This is a VERY small place. Reservations are suggested for this reason. The staff is all very nice. The bar was very busy the night we went and the place was booked until 9 pm. This caused a little delay I believe in being seated (even though we had a reservation) and the time it took the bar to get our drinks. The service overall is very quick. Have a great selection for the Raw bar, bust would be mostly for groups to share which didn't fit with the set up of the restaurant. Request not to sit at the tables by the door because if there is a wait they will be right on top of you. The appetizers where mostly standard. The sushi expensive.
November 29, 2011|There are better places around|2|There are better places around if you want raw oysters. Like the waitstaff. But, it's very much a bar scene and the restaurant is not particularly large; so the bar noise permeates the entire experience.

Perhaps a drier batter?? Roasted beet salad's flavor was fabulous but the beets were not really roasted or lacked flavor at any rate. Gave the food outstanding mainly for the tuna. We would go again, but it is pretty expensive for the overall quality of experience (would rather go to Gracie's for the overall value, service, outstanding food and ambience for example)
November 10, 2011|Good seafood choice, loud atmospher|4|Food was acceptable: I had swordfish and requested it on the rare side of med and it came exactly to my order. My wife's pasta/seafood dish was too salty they overdid the capers and it became overpowering. The noise was also overpowering. I dont understand why management/manager does not speak to overly boisterous tables when they have tables literally 2' apart. That will make me think again about going back there are lots of choices on Fed. Hill

November 5, 2011|Highly recommended|5|Great evening for my wife and myself prior to Les Miz. Food and service were excellent. Server friendly, knowledgable, attentive, but not overly so. You have to try the oyster sampler platter - if you like oysters. Pricey but worth it. Even the valet experience exceeded expectations.

October 27, 2011|The Treasured Pearl of Federal Hill|5|"As first time guests to this chic little Federal Hill restaurant,we arrived early (@ 5:45) which was a good idea as the restaurant filled up quickly.The bar was full of professionals taking advantage of the ""appy hour"". Seated at a comfortable table, we were immediately attended by both server and support staff who kept water glasses filled,bread with delicious dipping sauce full,plates effortlessly cleared & cocktails replenished.We started with the Triton Oyster Sampler,a 1/2 doz. of 3 different delicious fresh oysters.My partner had the Mahi Mahi special and I had chicken stuffed with spinach,mushrooms & fontina. All dishes and sides were perfection.We we're impressed by every facet of the charming vibrant restaurant and will return !"

October 7, 2011|Seafood Heaven|5|This is perhaps the best meal we have had on American soil in recent memory. From the raw bar to the oysters Rockefeller and clams casino to the scrumptious entrees (tender sea scallops over risotto and a lobster/pasta dish), every dish was expertly prepared and promptly served. The use of valet parking in this busy restaurant neighborhood is a must, and the valets were courteous and prompt.
October 7, 2011|Very good date night|4|Overall experience was great. Oysters were fantastic and fresh. Additional warm apps and salads were well prepared. Wait staff was great though our personal server was a but inattentive. Definitely returning though. Nothing earth shattering.

September 23, 2011|The service was excellent|5|The service was excellent and our food was amazing. I had the scallops over a goat cheese risotto, which was amazing. The risotto was cooked to perfection and complimented the scallops. My boyfriend had the salmon special, which he said was the best salmon he had ever had. It was charred on the outside, cooked to perfection and served over pumpkin ravioli. We have dined there in the past, and we will be returning.
September 23, 2011|I was on an extended business|5|"I was on an extended business trip when a friend of mine visited me for the weekend. We had an absolute blast that weekend and a visit to the Providence Oyster Bar was the ""opening ceremony"". Ever since I landed in at the Providence airport and spotted the Oyster Bar (two months earlier), I anxiously anticipated giving the joint a try. Let me tell you - there was absolutely no disappointment whatsoever!! My friend agrees. I'll have to add this spot as one of my all time favorite upscale seafood joints!!"
September 16, 2011|Food was excellent - wait|5|Food was excellent - wait staff, valet, hostess also excellent. The only complaint I have is that we were seated at a table next to the bar - which made it difficult to have a conversation. Restaurant is a little cramped.

September 2, 2011|Fantastic!|5|Great food, great experience. We always get seated right away when we have a reservation - even on a busy Friday or Saturday night, which can't be said for many places. The specials are always so delicious. The $30 wine list is a really great feature. The waitresses are alway very friendly and helpful (although, they all look the same! which is a very strange coincidence???) We ordered a espresso martini to share for dessert and the bartender was kind enough to split it in two glasses for us - and it was very yummy! And of course the oysters are always scrumptious.

August 15, 2011|As a frequent patron (best|4|"As a frequent patron (best oysters in Providence without the dress code)I must comment on the service...it was mediocre and I felt that we were more of a nuisance than an opportunity to our server. He also described one of the featured oysters as ""british colombian west coast"" (we still ordered them...and then ordered more) but you'd think that the server might be a bit more knowledgeable on the oyster selection. The lobster mashed potatoes had ZERO ""forkable"" pieces of lobster, which for a $12 side, you'd expect a bit more significance - they had a pink tint and a lobster flavor. Overall - food and drink were good."

August 3, 2011|My boyfriend and I are in|4|"My boyfriend and I are in the restaurant industry. On the down side of that, we are a young couple so we are used to servers jumping to conclusions thinking that we will not spend money since the stereotype of young customers is that they are on a very tight budget. Our server, Kelly was great. She ignored that we ""seemed"" like we wouldn't spend money as other restaurant staff has done in the past, and treated us like regular customers. As simple as that sounds, it feels great to be treated like any other person with a wallet. The calamari was good. Our oyster platter was to die for, which was the main reason why we came here. The atmosphere was quite romantic. There was nothing negative about my experience and I would come back again!"

Set some sticky traps somewhere to draw them away from the tables especially around food.

And, you're not paying extra for views or ambience... it's a crammed restaurant with a lot of volume. The menu is simple and uninspiring. I've been twice and I think I'm done for awhile.

Waiter was outstanding: appropriately attentive but not omnipresent; knowledgeable, friendly. My husband had the best martini he says he's ever had; we both had excellent dinners. A great place to celebrate a special occasion, but wouldn't necessarily recommend for a romantic evening, if you're looking for seclusion. Atmosphere was pleasant and not too loud. Would absolutely go again.

Amazing food, unique options, and overall an amazing experience. I have had the same server the last 3 times I've been there, her name escapes me, but if you get her you'll know it.

I had the sesame seared ahi which was superb, and an enormous portion - the lobster wontons that accompanied it were a little too stodgy for my taste, but my partner loved them. Great wine list with some unusual selections. We enjoyed a bottle of the 05 Renwood Zin - which was excellent. Very friendly bartender, who made a superb martini for my partner, and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for my vodka.
March 25, 2011|My first time at Oyster Bar.|4|My first time at Oyster Bar. Small space but very nicely furnished. Free Valet, always good on Federal Hill. Great section of wine menu of $30 bottles. Oysters were fresh and well presented. Menu has an impressive array of items at several price points, though the entrees are all on the high end. My husband and I shared the Seafood Paella. Several large shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chorizo and chicken. It was good, but very buttery and it seemed as though the chorizo might have been burnt in sections. Overall I would recommend it though it is not the best paella I've ever had. Desert was a very rich and delicious chocolate layer cake. I would eat there again and it's a great romantic spot as well.
March 25, 2011|This could be a favorite!|5|This is a long, narrow, almost New York style restaurant...sleek, bustling, warm ambience. We had asked for a quiet table, and loved our cozy spot in the rear of the restaurant. Two of us thoroughly enjoyed our cod with garlic, spinach and roma tomatoes, one was delighted with her shrimp entre and our 4th dined well on mussels. We told our waitress that we had to be out in time for the theater and she kept everything, including us, on schedule! It was our first visit to the Providence Oyster Bar and we were all enchanted. No problem at all using the groupon and we would definitely return!

Noise level was high and made conversation somewhat difficult for a table of six, it would have been fine for a smaller group, but otherwise loved the atmosphere. Our food was delicious and presented well. The oysters we had tasted fine, but were a bit small for the variety they were. Overall, definitely would return.
