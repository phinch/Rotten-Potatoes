February 15, 2016|Great for beer and sandwich|3|First time at G Pub and enjoyed it very much. Brought a friend for a light lunch and she was very pleased. The chips and sauce were great then we had the Inside out burger, very juicy and delicious. The waitress suggested a beer on tap that was just right . Well so much for the light lunch but it was worth it.

We moved to the bar and had a drink in less than a minute. Bar staff was great. Everyone was friendly. As for the wait staff, I strongly suggest more vigilance in regards to customer service and reasonably timed service.
January 28, 2016|Great place before PPAC|3|The burger was very good. They were out of the fried chicken sandwich by 6 PM. The service was not great. Our waitress kept disappearing.
January 8, 2016|Always Great!|4|Always a great meal! Pulled pork nachos are the best. The staff from the hostess, to the bartenders, and wait staff are all incredibly friendly and professional.

November 22, 2015|Dinner before the show|4|Took my Mom and Aunt here before a show at PPAC, not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. Though it has more of a Sports Bar / Craft Brew atmosphere, the food was excellent and the menu selection diverse. We split a plate of Nachos with Braised Beef (made the nacho plate a little watery, but still delish), and Fish Tacos which were seasoned perfectly. I can imagine this place gets extremely noisy when it's busy, but we were early enough that it wasn't too crowded. I will definitely take my husband and friends back here - the guys will love all the TV's, and I'm interested in scoring one of the little side-rooms for a group hang-out.

October 25, 2015|Great location for a dinner before a PPAC show.|5|Great location for a dinner before a PPAC show. Menu to please all tastes and a great beer and wine selection.
October 24, 2015|G Pub|4|Fun atmosphere and affordable fun! The karaoke rooms and game tables are s great way to unwind and have fun. It is a very affordable menu as well.
October 24, 2015|Had a reservation for the G Pub.  Asked ...|3|Had a reservation for the G Pub. Asked if it was appropriate for a 13 year old. I was told yes that children do come in. When we arrived our reservation was confirmed for 3. They proceeded to sit us at a high pub table by the bar. This would be ideal if we were not with a 13 year old. Noticed that there were booths on the other side of the bar that were empty. Asked if we could sit at a booth and we were told that the booths were for reservations. We had a reservation and they still said no. This was disappointing. Probably would not go back
October 17, 2015|Great first time, would definitely recommend|5|I had a great time at G Pub! I arrived with a small group a little after 5. It wasn't too crowded, the music was great (also not too loud so you can actually converse), I was served as soon as I sat at the bar. I love the atmosphere, the servers and bar tenders are friendly and knowledgable. My group sat at the bar and played table games until we were ready to be seated at our reservation time, the mini shuffleboard table is a great addition, tons of fun. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and I can't think of a single complaint. The food is unique and top notch. Easily one of my new favorite restaurant/bars in Providence. They definitely earned my repeated business!
October 17, 2015|Always Good!|4|Always have great food and excellent service at the G Pub! A nice place to go before a show at PPAC or after the show for drinks at the bar
October 3, 2015|Water fire night|4|Inadvertently, we decided to come on a Waterfire night, but really no problem. Food was good. Selection of craft brews was good. Really enjoyed the 4 beer tasting flight. Only thing is, the alet parking is not at the entrance to the restaurant. The night we went, also, some catering business was prepping food right on the sidewalk I front of the entrance door. Overall, we will return at some point.
September 24, 2015|Nice atmosphere. We went for a birthday....|4|Nice atmosphere. We went for a birthday. Fun time, interesting drink options. Food not bad. Service SO SLLOOOOOWWWWW. Kind of ruined the experience.
September 20, 2015|Staff needs more training|3|We went to G Pub because we received a coupon from PPAC. We were to get free valet parking a few appetizer. We couldn't find the valet attendant so I asked the hostess. This was either her first night or wasn't trained at all. She didn't think they had valet and after she spoke to the manager, she said they didn't have valet parking. I showed her our ticket. We found the valet attendant and had to drive around the block to enter the garage. The waiter was also new and was not familiar with the wines, he thought I was ordering a beer. We ordered 3 meals and app. We waited a long time for the app/calamari, it was good. I had to tell him we had theater tickets. Two out of the three meals were delivered correctly. My friend's meal was delivered to the wrong table so we had to wait for her cheeseburger to be recooked. We were not asked how we wanted our burgers cooked. We got our app free because of the coupon, but we did not get our misdelivered meal free for our inconvenience. This could be a great place to watch football. Since people are there two hours to watch the game, I guess the kitchen feels like they can take their time cooking meals. Food was good, but staff needs a lot of training. We never saw a manager.
September 19, 2015|Older patron|3|We had a late reservation. Apparently after a certain time it turns into a club environment rather than a restaurant. At approximately 1030, we were asked to give up our table. We certainly were not holding it up. We had been waiting for the check for over a half an hour with no communication with our waiter. It was apparent to us that we were 20 years older than everyone else in the restaurant and it was time to go, and they wished us to leave .
September 18, 2015|Easy eats before the show|4|Met friends for a quick simple meal before going to a show. Easy to make a reservation. Good menu selection. Food arrived hot and quickly and tasted good. Server was attentive. Just what we had planned.
September 17, 2015|Great eats|5|We were looking for something within walking distance to Lupo's heartbreak hotel as we were seeing a show. Made reservations really easy online and had no issues when arriving at the restaurant. We had the thai chicken wings and then the soft baked pretzels for an appetizer. Both were excellent. I had the Eiffel tower burger with truffle fries and my girlfriend had the smoked turkey club. The entrees definitely surpassed expectations and all the food was really tasty, had excellent quality ingredients with really good presentation. Very spacious and inviting atmosphere. I would definitely go back and will go back especially on Monday and Thursdays when they have specials like 50¢ wings, sliders and soft baked pretzels. The attention to detail with all the food was well received and spot on. We had a really nice and attentive waiter too. Service was great.
July 25, 2015|Food was very bland|3|Best part of the food...was the Edamame. Was fantastic, but fish tacos and calamari had no flavor at all and told our waitress. Atmosphere is pretty cool, but not worth it if they don't change the way they flavor their food.
June 26, 2015|Disappointed in Customer Service|3|Our waitress and hostess were lovely. However, there were two hostesses. The one who didn't seat us was HORRIBLY rude. When I first arrived and told them I had a reservation, one was accommodating, and the other rolled her eyes and made both me and my boyfriend incredibly uncomfortable. When we were leaving, we said thank you, one was lovely, and again, the other rolled her eyes and glared at us. I was very frustrated and do not want to go back because of that one girls service.
June 20, 2015|My family and I had a wonderful experien...|4|"My family and I had a wonderful experience for the most part. The bar seemed very slow, as it took an abnormally long time to get a new round to the table - however our meals and drinks were delicious. Burgers were flawless and our apps were tasty. My only real complaint is that the desserts were TERRIBLE. The lemon poppyseed ""cheesecake"" just tasted like flour and the texture was far from a typical cheesecake. The strawberry shortcake was a little sad too."
June 8, 2015|What a great find!|4|We were passing through Providence at lunch time so we used Open Table to find a place. If I didn't have the actual address I wouldn't have found the place as there was hardly any signage. This place must be so much fun at night! Great looking bar, tons of tables, then there is a whole adult section with pool tables and private karaoke rooms?? So cool! Our waitress informed us that this was her first day, but she was fantastic! Everything we ordered was delicious, most especially the Guatamalan soup they had on the menu that day. Tomato-based spicy broth filled with veggies (similar to a tortilla soup). Outstanding! Then we split a reuben and a cuban. Both were very filling portions and the fries were perfectly crispy. Would love to return again next time I'm in the area!
May 20, 2015|Poor training for all staff|1|Hostess looked inexperienced, frantic and not helpful when asked for help with WiFi Waiter looked at our table a few times before coming over....almost like....I really don't want to work Food was mediocre....how bad can they mess up burgers and nachos ?????
April 17, 2015|cool atmosphere but the food was fair|3|The atmosphere was cool. Nice bar, booths, a couple pool tables and hand shuffleboard. Has a cool happy hour vibe or maybe a stop over with a group of friends. The staff were friendly, but too anxious to take your order, clear your plates, and hand you the bill. Not a place to chill and have a long relaxing dinner. We had fish tacos - the contents came in a double layered corn tortilla. It was too overpowering for the contents inside. All I could taste was corn. It also got very soggy. They did not appear to grill or crisp up the tortilla. I would not order that again. I cant remember what my friend got. It was stew like, and had large pieces of prosciutto. She said it was ok. We were glad we tried the GPub but we will not go back for dinner. Perhaps, a burger would have proven to be a better choice. Drinks, sure.
April 9, 2015|Best Salad of my Life!|5|I've had the Caesar Salad and Gravy Fries twice. Generally I don't order the same thing twice but this is the best salad I've ever had. Each individual leaf of the romaine heart is dressed and cheesed and then stacked back together in their original orientation. I usually steal a few bites of my boyfriend's meal but I was too into this salad to even notice what he was eating. The gravy fries are appropriately crisp to stand up to the slather of sauce which was the perfect. The beer list is diverse and the service was friendly and fast. My only complaint is you can't get a pool table without a reservation but you can't make that reservation with your open table dinner reservation.
April 1, 2015|Food could be better...|2|G Pub has been opened for almost a year now and we decided to give it a try. Four of us went for dinner and these are our thoughts regarding what we had... Nachos: 3/10 Cheese sauce was processed, not tasty, chips were not brown, bland. Home made chips: 9/10. Crispy, with the right amount of salt, nice dipping sauce, too bad the serving size is so small. Fried Calamari: 2/10 Not crispy. Batter was bland and tasteless. We could not finish it, we left many pieces un-eaten. Alaska Cobb Salad: 7/10 The greens were fresh. I asked to get a seared salmon instead of the sour cream salmon and it was very good. I would get this salad again. Overall, a great spot for playing pool, karaoke, shuffle board, trivia. Food needs to be improved.

March 14, 2015|Fun, casual place, cool industrial decor...|4|Fun, casual place, cool industrial decor, good food & service & a ceative menu. Kind of a younger crowd but not to the extent it was awkward for 40- somethings like me! My husband & I will go back!
March 13, 2015|Might be to old for this place|3|This place is great for the after work scene. Lot of TV's for sports and the service is very good. It is very loud and hard to have a conversation with the person right next to you. Food was good but not near hot enough. Had I known that it had pool tables, I might have picked a different place to have dinner.

February 21, 2015|G Pub|4|Our waitress was very pleasant, she went out of her way to find me a bartender that would make my drink exactly how I like it. The food was great as always. They were also very understanding that a few people in our reservation party were unable to make it due to the weather yet we were seated in a very timely fashion. I will absolutely be returning for a night out to G Pub.
February 11, 2015|Great Work Dinner|4|Had a great work dinner - drinks and appetizers were great, dinner was also very good with the exception of one plate coming out a little later than the others, and when it arrived it was on the lukewarm side. Service was attentive without being overbearing; prices are reasonable for quality of food. Recommended.
February 1, 2015|Super Bowl|4|We found G Pub this fall and quickly realized it's the best place to watch the game. Crowd is mixed age and not to loud yet involved with the game. Food is far better than most sports bar. Service and atmosphere fantastic. A must for true sports fans!
January 18, 2015|Great times at G!|5|After dining at gastro pubs down the Cape, we were psyched to find Gpub here in Providence. Conveniently located with on street parking and private parking right on the corner this restaurant/bar is easy to find for locals and out of towners alike. The amazing industrial decor, pool tables and TVs at every booth and along the bar make this place a fun and cool environment to watch the game or have drinks and dinner with a significant other or a large group of friends. The food, amazing, drink list just as much so. We went during a game and got the incredible pretzels for only $1 a piece! We also had the house made jerky and pigs in a blanket made with wild boar sausage to start, needless to say none were left upon our entrees arrival! We split the deep fried hot dog which was just as sinful as it sounds. My date has the salmon and I had the meatloaf, both cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! For dessert the bread pudding, heavenly! The waitstaff was friendly and attentive throughout, patiently checking on us thoughout the game. Our experience was wonderful, my only regret is not having the appetite to eat more! I highly recommend and will be heading back to G soon!
January 10, 2015|Great Food but Leave the Kids at Home|3|I loved the over all experience, but it is a highly energetic bar scene which was a bit overwhelming for my kids & the lack of a true kids menu made it a little tough (chicken fingers are a kid must have for us ... I have a kid that doesn't eat hot dogs, mac n cheese or burgers). The portions are perfect & the quality of the food was fantastic. We'll be back, but as a pair.

December 29, 2014|Awful service tonight...|2|I've had very good experiences at G-Pub in the past and was excited to bring 3 friends there tonight for the first time. The service was embarrassing. Out waiter Dylan missed our drink orders several time and we had to keep reordering them. Out main dishes were brought out BEFORE our apps and he blamed the kitchen. Finally, we asked to take home the left-overs (our appetizers which came late) and waited at the table over 20 mins--it never arrived. When I walked over and asked Dylan about it he said he thought we didn't want it so he threw it out. The food was good--but the service tonight ruined the entire experience. I sensed that other tables were having similar issues...

November 14, 2014|Personal TV at each Booth!|4|The place is really cool. Lots of TV's, pool tables, shuffleboard and I heard there are karaoke rooms as well. The coolest part is personal TV's at each booth. We had gone to watch the USA vs Colombia soccer game. And it was awesome to have a TV to watch while we drank and ate right at our booth.
November 7, 2014|Great atmosphere for a first date|5|Love the interior design of this place. Beautiful industrial style. Perfect for first date. Ate some delicious food (the mussels were incredible) and played some pool. Had a great time. Love it!
October 25, 2014|Fun and Friendly|5|Cool twist on an every day menu. GREAT drink selection!
October 24, 2014|GPub|4|Providence’s exciting down-city dining scene has been further enhanced by its newest ultra-fun, ultra-cool gastropub – GPub
October 18, 2014|great little spot|5|Loved the warehouse atmosphere. The calamari appetizer was crispy with a little hit red pepper and a tartar sauce like dipping sauce. Great homemade chips with pub cheese. Edamame has spicy sriracha sauce..delicious! Riesling was sweet and priced right. I will be back!
October 3, 2014|great place for a drink|3|They have a great craft beer selection and nice bar. The food on the other hand is much to be desired.
October 3, 2014|great place!|4|Really good food in a cool hip environment! Great service, drinks and vibe. Very industrial environment, can be a bit loud! I thought the prices we're affordable and the food servings we're large!
September 26, 2014|Great place to go out with friends|4|Great atmosphere but a little too noisey. You could barely hear anyone talk. Great food and beer and the service was excellent.
September 21, 2014|Great Place!|4|Casual fun place to stop in for drinks or a meal! Excellent food at very reasonable prices. Fabulous pulled pork nachos and great game day specials. TV's all around so you can catch the game but not so loud that you can't have conversations at your table. Great service!

September 7, 2014|Great dining experience!|5|We went for dinner and drinks pre show at the PPAC. Plenty of parking in the area and a fun feel to the place. Our server, Greg, was fun, engaging and very knowledgeable of the beer and menu items. The food was creative and very well prepared. Portions were generous and an over all great value.
September 6, 2014|Low-key night out|4|Good for a few beers and burger...to watch a game and just hang out with friends. Modern atmosphere, like inside a mill. Fun place for a chill night.
September 6, 2014|Food unimpressive|2|Possibly might return for drinks and the soft pretzel snack...but the food was not good at all. Even the basic burger was inedible.
September 5, 2014|Needs some work|2|It was very loud. The service was fair. Some ordered appetizers as their meal and they were brought out with the soups and salads instead of with everyone else's dinner. Food was ok - nothing spectacular. The chowder was great. The nachos had fake cheese on them. I probably would not return.
August 24, 2014|Karaoke|5|Karaoke room was awesome great service the waitress was very attentive
August 16, 2014|Group Event|4|I went to G Pub with 16 friends for the start of a bachelor party. The food was great and inexpensive. They had a good beer selection. We spent most of out time playing shuffleboard and pool. I was surprised the place wasn't busy at all. I would definitely go back the next time I am on PROV.
July 25, 2014|Should be better.|2|G Pub atmosphere was friendly and comfortable- with volume. There were interesting drinks and food selections on the menu. Neither lived up to their description or price. Take a few dollars off per item- or make them a bit bigger- and then I could see eating there in a pinch. Was that really pastrami? The waiters were quite nice and accommodating but could have used a bit more basic training-. You do not clear dishes while other people in the party are still eating nor while customer is still eating- for one example.

July 17, 2014|great service|5|We had a great first experience. the food was great, the service was excellent, and we were able to occupy a tap room, which is a fun concept! I highly recommend this up and coming bar.
June 26, 2014|cool comfort food style menu, great beer...|3|cool comfort food style menu, great beer list, but really quite loud due to solid concrete construction.
June 24, 2014|Good but Slow|3|I must start by saying I really like the ProvG Pub. But my third trip there was a bit frustrating. They were clearly understaffed for a lunch rush. The waitresses blamed the kitchen for being overloaded. The noise level was a little higher than usual. When the food came, it was very good, just what I ordered, and served hot or cold, as applicable. But to do business in Downcity, you have to know your key audience and their eating habbits or you will become a relic quickly.
June 21, 2014|New Downtown Prov Burger Joint|3|G Pub is a relatively new below street-level pub in downtown Providence. I liked the place even though the crowd was mostly young. Decent food, decent service, and good beer list.
June 7, 2014|Very Cool; We'll be Back|4|Had never tried G Pub but had heard good things. Was very impressed with design of he restaurant. Our server ROCKED IT! She pretty much gave us a virtual tour of the rest of the renovated Providence Gas Company building. The way she described everything we could picture what it would look like. Food sounded impressive from the menu and from our server's description. We had high expectations and were a little let down. Perhaps they're still getting the kinks out in the kitchen. We all said we would go back for the atmosphere and the service for cocktails (which were very cool...wine on tap!) but the food wouldn't bring us back - it also wouldn't keep us away.
June 6, 2014|OK place to grab a quick bite|3|Went to dinner on Friday night as it was recommended by one of my neighbors. Mad a reservation for 8:00 PM as it was an option to do so. When my fiance and I arrived it was not very busy which was kind of surprising to me as it was a Friday night. The hostess was very nice and when I told her I had a reservation for 8:00 PM she knew who I was right away. Our waitress seemed new so she was not very attentive but was pleasant. This was our first experience with a Gastropub so we didn't really know what to expect. The food was excellent but the portion sizes were not overwhelming to say the least and a lot of it was a la carte. It had subway tiles on the walls which made it echo but it was not too bad. Overall not a bad experience.
May 24, 2014|Gpub|2|Food was very under seasoned, every dish ordered was bland had to add salt to everything. Fried chicken takes longer but they didn't time it well so everyone else had their food first while the last person waited.
May 18, 2014|Versatile |4|G Pub is a great place to go whether you are out for a drink or looking for a great meal (or both of course). The atmosphere is modern upscale/industrial looking. There are games like pool and shuffleboard, which is a plus; however these games can add to the high noise level. Overall I've enjoyed myself at G Pub!
May 7, 2014|great addition to downtown|4|Glad to see this building be revitalized. Great pub food. Great beers on tap. service was great as well.
May 2, 2014|Friday Night|5|We had a lovely time at G pub this past Friday night, everything was amazing. The atmosphere was very loud and energetic as we walked in but again, it was a Friday night. Our waitress was lovely, very upbeat and attentive. We started off with Pulled Pork Nachos which were delicious and messy, as nachos should be. For entrées we had the Meat & Potatoes and the Cowboy Steak. The Meat & Potatoes was a solid dish, the sides were excellent. Cowboy Steak was just as excellent, cheddar cheese grits? YES PLEASE. We ended the evening with two desserts, because why not. The white trash trifle was delightful and the fudged it was a dream come true. We will without a doubt be back.
April 30, 2014|Great lunch|4|My husband and I stopped in for lunch and we were not disappointed. Great food and service in a really cool atmosphere. We will definitely be back.
April 12, 2014|Cold food|3|We had a great server. However, in our party of six 3 meals were served cold. My chicken sandwich was pretty sad with only a smudge of guacamole and tiny bit of pico. Really was expecting a better food experience. Beers were good.
April 10, 2014|New and upscale|3|Exciting new pub with young crowd but food only standard hopefully will survive as it is pricey
April 2, 2014|Great time!|4|I love the energetic feel of this place - puts you in a good mood! The BLT was great and the hand cut fries were delish! I would definitely return to try more dishes. Sami was a great waitress - attentive but not overbearing.
March 30, 2014|The fish tacos were some of|5|The fish tacos were some of the best i've ever had! Looking forward to going back!
March 29, 2014|The decor of the place is|2|The decor of the place is great. There was a little bit of a scramble finding our reservation but eventually we got a table next to the bar which was fine. Our waitress was fantastic--super friendly and great service. Our food was so-so--and kind of cold even though it was supposed to be hot. This place is great for big groups--people can roam around and they seem to accomodate big groups really well. Wish the food was more special and we would go back.
March 28, 2014|We went there for lunch and|4|We went there for lunch and both ordered fish tacos. Food was delicious, but a little slow in coming to the table.
March 21, 2014|overbooked|1|"I had a 715 reservation. The table that they were planning to put our party was just being served their dinner at 715, so the earliest we would get to our table was probably 745.. They had a few other tables that were open, and had been unoccupied for a good hour, and would have accommodated my group, but they refused to sit us at any of the other open tables, as they were ""reserved"". I would have understood if the place was packed and there were no open seats, but to see open tables since 6pm and be told they can only sit u at this one specific table was not appreciated. We ended up leaving and going to Bar Louie for dinner and to watch the Friars game."
March 21, 2014|Great place for drinks|4|This is a great place for happy hour or for a few drinks. A really fun, energetic place-great addition to the bar scene in Providence.
March 21, 2014|Fantastic|5|G Pub has it all. It's my new favorite spot. They've got great food and a huge selection of beer, wine and liquor. What really sticks out to me is how good the service is. I've been there 4 times now and every time it was a 10 out of 10. I highly recommend it.
March 15, 2014|When you enter G Pub through|5|When you enter G Pub through its unassuming facade, a single glass paned door, you don't really expect much. Then you descend down into a super, beautiful industrial space with features that quietly reveal themselves i.e. backlit wood panels, the grain of wood on the booth tables, the fact that the chefs are big, bearded fellows (never trust a skinny cook.) The food is deconstructed, pub faire and the insanely low prices of said food will make you expect lesser quality, fret not you get pristine quality for the dough you are dishing out. The one draw back is that the beer menu does not impress me much, I am admittedly a giant beer snob but there is a precedent for amazing food paired with complex, hard-to-find beer on draft.
